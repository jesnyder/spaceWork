                                   "Experiments were conducted in a human centrifuge. The protocol aimed at mimicking a routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and included 10-min exposure to +1.4 - +3.5 Gz. Subjects were exposed three times to this sequence, breathing air, 44.5% O2 or 100% O2.\n\nTen volunteers wearing anti-G trousers participated in the study. The Ethics Committee Ile-de-France III and the French National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) approved the protocol (number 2009-A01092-55).\n\nThree different imaging techniques, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), pulmonary ultrasound and chest SPECT/CT were used and compared. EIT enabled ventilation monitoring in the human centrifuge, whereas pulmonary ultrasound and SPECT/CT gave functional and topographical information before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations. EIT analysis focused on regional ventilation, SPECT on global lung ventilation and perfusion, CT on the presence of atelectasis, and pulmonary ultrasound analysis looked for comet tails in 64 chest areas. Arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously by finger photoplethysmography. Cardiac output and stroke volume were computed from these recordings, using three different algorithms. Echocardiography was used as reference non-invasive technique for stroke volume determination and performed before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations."

The proposed research program takes a new approach which could lead to an effective, practical and acceptable protocol for preadapting astronauts to space flight. By using the gravito-inertial alterations possible with centrifugation in different body orientations the investigators will quantify an individual's sensory adaptation capability and use it to predict and to minimize the consequences of movement in any other gravity environment - eventually including weightlessness. The investigators will also study whether a drug (promethazine) affects motion perception and motion sickness."

                                   "Investigations description ----------------------------------\n\nDuring the experiments, subjects will jump in different gravity fields while submitted to an additional pull-down force equal to 0-100% of their body weight on Earth. During the takeoff and landing phases of the jumps, the ground reaction force will be recorded by a force-platform, the movements of the limb segments will be recorded by means of a high-speed camera and the electrical activity (EMG) of the main lower limb muscles will be recorded by means of surface electrodes.\n\nForce platform and Subject Loading System We have developed a device that combines a force platform on which the subject jumps and a Subject Loading System (SLS) that pulls the subject downwards.\n\nThe force platform is a 60 cm x 40 cm aluminum plate equipped with four force-transducers that measure the three components of the force exerted by the subject's feet on the ground.\n\nThe SLS consists in two pneumatic pistons, which are attached to a harness on one end and to the aluminum plate on the other. The SLS can be set to generate a force equal to 20-100% of the subject's body weight on Earth.\n\nA security handrail (not shown on the picture) is attached to the aluminum plate, around the force-platform in case of unbalance of the subject.\n\nEMG EMG will be recorded with a MyoSystem 1400L using surface electrodes. The skin will be shaved (if necessary) and the electrodes will be attached with double sided tape and plaster. The electrodes will be placed at the level of the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus, and on the thigh at the level of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and lateral hamstrings and medial hamstrings. There will be 2 electrodes per muscle (fixed one against the other) and one reference electrode placed at the level of the C7 vertebra.\n\nManufacturer: Noraxon. Conformity certificate: CE 344\n\nVideo Movements of the subject will be recorded by means of a high-speed digital camera (Basler). In order to facilitate video analysis, 7 reflective markers (hemisphere with a 12 mm diameter) will delimit body segments: 3 will be glued on one shoe, 3 will be fixed on the skin (with the same method used for EMG electrodes) at the level of the ankle, knee, hip of one limb and the last one will be fixed on the neck.\n\nExperimental protocol\n\n----------------------------\n\nBefore flight subjects will be familiarized with the setup and the protocol. For each flight day, one subject will be studied. The procedure will be the following on all 3 days.\n\nThe experiment day starts at 7.30 a.m. with the test subject equipped with EMG electrodes and video markers. After take-off and after work is permitted, the subject goes to the experimental area where it is equipped with the SLS harness. Before each parabola, the subject stands beside the platform to adjust the zero level of the sensor (about 3 second). Then the subject steps on the platform to record his weight (about 3 second).\n\nDuring the hypergravity initial part in of the parabola, the subject is standing with is two feet on each side of the platform. The traction system is loose (5 kg traction). During the injection, the traction system starts to progressively pull downwards on the subject. The traction force is tuned between 20% and 100% of body weight on Earth. The traction force is constant during each parabola. During the 20 second of weightlessness or partial gravity, the subject jumps several times. At the end of the parabola, the subject puts his feet at the side of the platform and the traction system stops to pull downwards before the pull out phase.\n\nThis experiment will also be performed during periods of increased gravity obtained during turns of the airplane. Three turns per flight should be performed at 3 levels of gravity: 1.2, 1.4 g and 1.6 g.\n\nDuring each parabola or turn, one experimenter is taking care of the control of the traction system and of the collection of the data, a second one takes care of the image acquisition, and a third one takes care of the modification of the configuration of the harness between the parabolas and of the safety of the subject in case of unbalance during the parabolas or during the turn."

                                   "On the eve of the next long voyages into space and the event of space tourism, it becomes more and more urgent to understand how to preserve the health of spacemen (i.e., by profession or by leisure). Extreme and unusual environments, and isolated and confined environments (EUE/ICE) are characterized by unique sensory stimulation. They are known to have negative effects on human psychology, cognitive abilities and physiology, threatening the outcome of space missions or travel. In addition, with the construction of the future Gateway base, the upcoming colonies to Mars and space tourism, travel from one point to another will be much more frequent. These raise new questions that will have to be addressed, whether it is the prolonged duration of a stay in a microgravity environment (i.e., absence of gravitational force between man and his support), in partial gravity and thus the issue of recovery from one trip to the next. These modifications of the environment imply the implementation of several adaptation processes to preserve the homeostatic capacity of the organism. This allows the organism to maintain a relatively stable internal state that persists despite external changes. Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered. One such question is the impact of repeated changes in gravity during flight to the point of attachment (e.g., colony). The objective of the study is therefore to better understand the relationship between the body and its environment due to repeated changes in gravity, including microgravity.\n\nBeyond that, these results will contribute to enrich the knowledge of this real human challenge that is the question of the adaptation of the human being to the constraints of space travel."

                                   "Parabolic flights make it possible to produce a reduced gravity environment on Earth. With the specially adapted A310 Zero-G, each parable produces a period of zero gravity (\"0g\"). The duration of the periods of reduced gravity is about 21 seconds. Each parable begins and ends with a resource (hyper-gravity) at 1.8 g; each resource lasts about 20 seconds. A typical flight lasts from two to three hours and includes 30 parabolic maneuvers, usually all in weightlessness.\n\nParticipants will arrive at Novespace, at Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport, no later than 2 pm the day before the first flight of the campaign in order to participate in the security briefing. A delay of at least 2 hours will be granted before collection of their written consent.\n\nBefore the flight, the participants will necessarily participate in the safety briefing (2h, organized by the Flight Manager (Novespace) and will meet the research team to become familiar with the procedures and devices that will be used during the experiment.\n\nOn the day of the flight, the participants will have to arrive at the premises of Novespace before 7.30am.\n\nBefore the flight, they will be prepared for flight recordings. Seven self-adhesive electrodes will be placed on the chest to measure the electrical activity of the heart and the blood volume in the chest.\n\nA venous blood test to measure blood markers of oxidative stress will be performed by a doctor or a registered nurse.\n\nDoppler and ultrasound operators will make blood flow measurements in the vertebral, internal carotid, posterior cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries) using an echo-doppler device. These measures are strictly non-invasive and painless. Participants can take medication against motion sickness under the supervision of the flight doctor. The duration of the study is a little less than 6 hours (2 hours before the flight, 3 hours flight, 30 minutes after the flight).\n\nPreparation before parables, in the plane. In addition to the participant, two other subjects will be the participants of the flight, one will also be a subject, and the third will be a rescue participant who will be tested in case the subject or his partner falls ill during the flight. The flight includes 31 parables, but the first participant will be subject only for 16 parables and the second for 15.\n\nWhen it is not subject, the participant is rid of equipment and can join the so-called \"free floating\" area to enjoy the sensations of weightlessness.\n\nAfter takeoff, but before the first parable the subject (or the other participant) will sit on a chair built for the flight. His pelvis will be immobilized by restraints to prevent him from floating freely during the weightlessness.\n\nIt will be connected to different measuring equipment, all non-invasive:\n\nAn arterial pressure sensor on the finger. Electrotrocardiogram (connected to 3 self-adhesive electrodes) Thoracic impedance meter (connected to 4 self-adhesive electrodes) An oxygen scope (for measuring the expired CO2).\n\nDuring the flight During each phase of weightlessness, an operator will apply on the neck or skull of the subject an ultrasound measurement probe (as on the ground). We recommend that participants do not move their head, especially during periods of hypergravity, to prevent motion sickness.\n\nExcept in exceptional circumstances, the aircraft normally completes the mission, but it must be clear that the subject is free to withdraw his consent and participation in the experiment at any time, without prejudice to him or to any other reason, without justification, including during the flight.\n\nAfter the flight Following the flight, a second venous sample will be made to determine the effects of weightlessness on the markers of oxidative stress."

Focus is on lung tissue compression, ventilation and regional perfusion. In addition, the influence of hypobaria on these parameters is assessed.\n\nThis study is conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee Ile-de-France III (ref. 3274) and the French National Agency for Drug Safety ANSM have approved the protocol (ref. ID RCB 2015-A00485-44 and ANSM 151046B-32).\n\nPrimary aim, item 1: Experiments are conducted in a human centrifuge. The protocol mimics a routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and includes 1hr05 min at +1Gz followed by 10-min exposure to +1.4 to +3.5Gz . Subjects are exposed three times to this sequence, breathing at positive pressure levels of 0, 5 or 10 hPa. Two groups of sixteen healthy male non-smoking volunteers, wearing anti-G trousers, are studied and compared: group 1 breathes air, group 2 100% O2.\n\nPrimary aim, item 2: Experiments are conducted in a hypobaric chamber. Sixteen healthy male non-smoking volunteers are exposed to four conditions: 0 or 15,000 ft altitude, breathing air or 100%O2. Protocol duration is 1h15min. Positive breathing pressure can be applied depending on the results of the experiments of item 1.\n\nSecondary aim: Experiments are conducted in a human centrifuge. Sixteen healthy male non-smoking volunteers are exposed to four conditions: uninflated or inflated anti-G trousers (175 hPa), +1 or +3.5 Gz for 3 min."

                                   "Many individuals with tinnitus have abnormal oscillatory brain activity in their temporal areas (Weisz et al. (2005), Schlee et al. (2014)). Led by this finding, attempts to normalize such localized pathological activity by neuro-feedback techniques have been tested (Dohrmann et al. (2007), G\u00fctenspenger et al. (2017)). These attempts highlighted interindividual variability that can be explained by lack of selection of the patient population and lack of guidance through the therapy. The present study is aimed at addressing these issues by choosing more selectively a patient subpopulation (tinnitus associated with moderate hearing loss) and by implementing a guidance interface during the treatment.\n\nThe therapy will consist of 10 neuro-feedback training sessions of 29 minutes over 5 weeks. Each session will be composed of 6 blocks of 3 min in which the patient will be incited to practise a specific cognitive strategy (mental exercise such as \"think to a music you like\") and resting state measurements.\n\nEach patient who has been recruited to fit our inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will first go through a clinical assessment of his initial judgment criteria metrics. Then subjects will go through the 5-week training and then will be evaluated on the same criteria just after the end of the therapy and at 3 months after the end of it."
