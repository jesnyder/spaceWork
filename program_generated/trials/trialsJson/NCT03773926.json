              "Neuro-feedback for treating tinnitus seem to be a promising approach to help people suffering from chronic tinnitus. The past studies on this approach suffered interindividual variability in their results. The investigators' current hypothesis is that the variability of the results is the consequences of two possible flaws: lack of appropriate patient selection and lack of support of the patient during the therapy. This study is aimed at testing these hypotheses."

              "Many individuals with tinnitus have abnormal oscillatory brain activity in their temporal areas (Weisz et al. (2005), Schlee et al. (2014)). Led by this finding, attempts to normalize such localized pathological activity by neuro-feedback techniques have been tested (Dohrmann et al. (2007), G\u00fctenspenger et al. (2017)). These attempts highlighted interindividual variability that can be explained by lack of selection of the patient population and lack of guidance through the therapy. The present study is aimed at addressing these issues by choosing more selectively a patient subpopulation (tinnitus associated with moderate hearing loss) and by implementing a guidance interface during the treatment.\n\nThe therapy will consist of 10 neuro-feedback training sessions of 29 minutes over 5 weeks. Each session will be composed of 6 blocks of 3 min in which the patient will be incited to practise a specific cognitive strategy (mental exercise such as \"think to a music you like\") and resting state measurements.\n\nEach patient who has been recruited to fit our inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will first go through a clinical assessment of his initial judgment criteria metrics. Then subjects will go through the 5-week training and then will be evaluated on the same criteria just after the end of the therapy and at 3 months after the end of it."

              "The secondary outcome measure denotes the evolution of the intensity of tinnitus and the disturbance associated measured by two scales. First the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for intensity of Tinnitus enables the patient to rate his tinnitus intensity with integers values between 1 to 10 (included). Second, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Tinnitus associated disturbance enables the patient to rate his tinnitus associated diturbance with integers values between 1 to 10 (included). For both scales, a high value (near 10) indicates a high gravity of the symptom, regarding either its intensity or its associated disturbance, while low values (near 1), indicate lighter impact of the symptom regarding its intensity or its associated disturbance. The scores are assessed subjectively by the patient when asked.",
