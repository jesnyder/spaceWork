During a randomized 60 day bed rest study in 20 healthy male adults the two following aims will be undertaken:\n\nSixteen scientific protocols will assess the changes in the cardiovascular, metabolism, muscle, bone, neuro sensorial, hematological and immunology systems.\nIn the above mentioned systems, the potential beneficial effects of the countermeasure protocol will also be investigated."

              "Space flights have shown the possibilities and limitations of human adaptation to space. For the last 50 years, results showed that the space environment and microgravity in particular, cause changes that may affect the performance of astronauts. These physiological changes particularly challenge the cardiovascular, metabolic, muscle and bone functions. Space agencies regularly conduct simulations on the ground on healthy volunteers to mimic the effects of weightlessness (head down bed rest model) to better understand the mechanisms of adaptations of the organism to space, and develop ways to prevent and / or reduce the negative biological effects of microgravity on astronauts. These protocols are called countermeasures. Since the beginning of space missions, various countermeasures have been tested on the ground and in-flight, including different exercise protocols. To date, however, none has been entirely satisfactory and space agencies continue to conduct simulation studies to evaluate new countermeasures. Nowadays, the human spaceflight program has entered the next phase of space exploration towards the Moon and Mars and there are clearly inherent medical challenges with such a goal, among which, countermeasure developments are a clear priority.\n\nBased on recent evidences, the next countermeasure to be tested during a 60-day bed rest includes a nutritional countermeasure composed of an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory dietary mix."

              "This will be performed by using MR scanning sequences that specifically measure water and fat signals then calculate the respective content.",
              "Next generation sequencing (NGS) of IgM heavy chain transcripts extracted from PBMC will 1) indicate if the expression frequencies of Ig gene segments are modified during bed rest thereby indicating a change in B lymphopoiesis (because each B cell created in the marrow is characterized by its own VH-D-JH-C\u00b5 mRNA) and 2) allow the assessment of the activities of enzymes required for the formation of the B cell antigen receptor repertoire.\n\nFlow cytometry will be used to determine if there is an egress of HSC/progenitors from the bone marrow into blood stream thereby indicating a decrease of the interactions between HSC and their niche. The same technique will be used to determine if there are changes in B cell subsets in peripheral blood.",
              "Mass spectrometry will be performed on proteins obtained from muscle biopsies, microdialysis and serum. The generated peptides will be analysed using high resolution mass shot-gun mass spectrometry.",
              "The end point is a reduction in muscle pump indices: a) decrease in causality between EMG and Blood pressure, b) decrease in gain between EMG and Blood pressure, and c) decrease in the interaction time between EMG and Blood pressure.",
              "Skeletal muscle insulin resistance will be assessed during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp.\n\nWhole blood will be immediately analyzed for glucose concentration, serum insulin will be quantified by radioimmunoassay and catecholamines will be quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Peripheral insulin sensitivity will be calculated during the final hour of the clamp in steady state.",
              "Both structural and functional brain changes associated with head-down bedrest will be examined by 3T MRI. Imaging sequence parameters will be selected to maximize sensitivity to effects of interest.",
              "Subjects perform a video game-like task of shooting a projectile out of a hand-held tool so that it passes between the gaps of an oriented target grill. Since the projectile and the tool are long and narrow, the subject must place the tool at the same orientation as the grill to achieve success. On certain trials, the subject is required to move the head between the time that the target is acquired and the moment of the response. Trials vary in terms of what the subject can see and feel during the execution of the task, and on body posture.\n\nA 3D motion caption system is used to track in real-time the movements of the subject' head and hands. A virtual reality helmet is used to provide visual and audio information. A moving head support will be used to allow the subject to tilt the head laterally in both seated and laying conditions.",

              "Vastus Lateralis needle biopsies will be performed before, at the end of the Head Down Tilt period (after about 60 days of bedrest) and of the recovery phases. Change in levels of S-nitrosylated proteins will be measured in active vs. atrophic muscle following extended bed rest.",

              "In a healthy standing subject, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) evokes a postural sway response directed towards the anode electrode. The direction of the response is fixed in head coordinates and so it will rotate as the head is turned. To determine if bedrest has affected the accuracy and precision of this sway response, we will measure the direction of the ground reaction force (GRF) response evoked by GVS in standing volunteers under different head orientations. The mean direction (accuracy) along with the trial-to-trial variability (precision) of the GRF vector will be separately determined. Any reduction in accuracy or precision will indicate degraded vestibular control of balance.",
              "24h ECG Holters will be done at different timepoints of the study (pre, during and after the bedrest phase). A conventional Holter analysis will be performed using dedicated commercial software. Moreover, the recordings obtained will be analyzed using several advanced signal processing techniques, which will be focused on different aspects of ventricular repolarization."
