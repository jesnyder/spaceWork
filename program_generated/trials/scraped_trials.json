                            "Microgravity during space flight induces physiological changes that affect astronauts' health and performance. Space flight simulations such as prolonged bed rest can mimic some of these changes and provide study conditions that are more accessible than during space flight. The European Space Agency, ESA together with the French national space agency, CNES and the Japanese national space agency, NASDA are performing extensive studies using long duration bed rest.\n\nPrevious studies including several long and short term bed rest campaigns have yielded significant medical data on the physiological changes induced by space flight. These data can be used to study the effect of countermeasures, methods helping to prevent these physiological changes.\n\nThe long duration bed rest, lasting 3 months undertakes a variety of investigations involving 28 subjects. This study focuses on countermeasures, studying the effect of a bone tissue stabilisation medication and resistive exercises to determine their suitability for use during long duration stays on ISS.\n\nThe physiological changes recorded during space flight and bed rest mimic those observed in some diseases and in the aging process. Significant clinical applications are expected as a direct result of this experiment and future equivalent studies."

                            "The spaceflights undertaken to date demonstrated that Man can adapt to the conditions existing in space, particularly to weightlessness. However, the space environment and the prevailing micro-gravity induce modifications which may affect the performances of the astronauts. These modifications concern in particular the cardiovascular and hormonal systems, the muscles, the bones, the blood and the immune system. Other problems may occur during long duration flights, such as the problems created by psychological stress due to the confinement, or those resulting from the cosmic rays (radiation).\n\nIn view of the fact that space flight opportunities are few, experiences simulating the effects of weightlessness experiences are undertaken on the earth, in order to better understand the adaptation mechanisms, prepare the spaceflights, perfect and evaluate corrective methods (called counter-measures) such as physical exercise or medication, to facilitate the astronauts' return to base. These experiments are also a necessity, in view of the difficulties encountered when carrying out certain experiences during the flights, due to the presence of too few astronauts on board, and to the lack of advanced biomedical devices onboard (scanner, etc.). The most common simulation is that of the anti-orthostatic bed rest (tilted position with the head slightly under the feet at a -6\u00b0 angle).\n\nSince the current objective is to simulate flights in the International Space Station (3 to 6 months) or possible flights to Mars (500 to 1000 days), it is mandatory to extend the duration of the simulation experiments. This is why three Space Agencies, CNES (France), European Space Agency (ESA, European Union), National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA, Japan) decided to join forces and undertake in common such simulation campaigns on ground, to best apprehend the adaptation processes to the constraints of the space environment.\n\nThe 2 main objectives of this experiment are:\n\nto study the physiological changes mechanisms during a ground-based experiment simulating long duration spaceflights,\nto develop and validate preventive methods (countermeasures) using standard tests.\n\nThis is why we will test in the present study the effects of an orthostatic bed rest (decubitus) of 90 days (3 months) on the following physiological systems :\n\nthe bones,\nthe muscles,\nthe cardiovascular system and its control mechanisms,\nthe sleep,\nthe spine.\n\nIn the absence of gravity, the weight of the astronaut and that of the objects disappear completely. This induces modifications of the bones and the muscles which can severely affect the astronaut's life during the flight, and even more when returning to earth. This is a fundamental point to study, since it may become a limiting factor and even an obstacle to long duration flights. This experiment should also permit the test of physical exercise program and of a drug, pamidronate (AREDIA\u00ae), as counter-measures against the effects of weightlessness on the locomotion system (skeleton and muscles).\n\nA total of 28 volunteers will participate to this experiment, split into three groups. Said experiment will spread on 2 years, 14 volunteers participating each time. The 3 groups are the following:\n\nGroup \"physical exercise\" (9 volunteers),\nGroup \"drug\" (pamidronate) (9 volunteers),\nGroup \"control\" (10 volunteers).\n\nMembers of the groups will be drawn by lot among the participants\n\nGroup \"Exercise\" : exposure of Man to microgravity results in a muscular atrophy which affects the muscles of the lumbar region and those of the lower limbs which are concerned by the standing position and the locomotion. During certain flights, physical exercise programs have been implemented, in order to fight against this muscular atrophy, maintain the physical condition required for the mission and prepare the astronauts for their return on earth. In the course of the present experiment, a physical exercise program will be tested on the 9 volunteers of this group (resistance training using both calf and knee extensor muscles with a special devicecalled Fly-Wheel).\nGroup \"Drug\" : a Man in microgravity is the sole experimental model available to test the rapid occurrence of osteoporosis on a healthy subject. Osteoporosis, or porous bone, appears whenever the rate at which the bone material is replaced falls below that of resorption, thus creating a bone fragility and an increased risk of fracture (hip, spine and wrist essentially). It appears generally after menopause, when associated with aging and a lack of physical activity. The pamidronate (Aredia\u00ae) is a drug present on the market since many years, used for the treatment of several bone pathologies. This drug will be tested on the 9 volunteers of this group, to demonstrate its efficiency in treating of bone modifications. This drug (60mg) will be infused intravenously 14 days before bed rest.\nGroup \"control\" : this group will serve as reference for the experimentation. Volunteers in this group will be without physical exercise and without drug. The existence of this group is necessary to be able to compare the results of the 2 types of counter-measures.\n\nThe experience will be carried out during a 120 days stay (a total of 4 months) at the Space Clinic and will comprise:\n\n1 control ambulatory period of 15 days (subjects to report on day before) (-15 at -1),\n1 anti-orthostatic (-6\u00b0) bed rest period of 90 days (1 at 90),\n1 recovery ambulatory period of 15 days (subjects to depart the following morning) (+1 at +15), representing a total of 122 nights spent at the clinic for all volunteers.\n\nThe assessments will be done by different European and Japanese scientific teams,each one specialising in a specific domain. None of the 3 groups of volunteers will be submitted to all experimentation programs."

                            "Head down tilt (HDT) was widely used to simulate microgravity effects on cardiovascular system. HDT could be a suitable model of water immersion (WI) which is also used to simulate the cardiovascular effects of microgravity and which is not easy to study in laboratory. To define the possibility to simulate immersion by HDT, a comparison between these models is required. A comparison between WI and few angles during HDT seems necessary to understand which angle is more adapt.\n\nThe immersion induces an increase of the central blood volume. This increase is caused by a redistribution of blood from peripheral portions of the body to the intrathoracic circulation. It seems to load cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptors. These baroreceptors bring into play autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation and induce a bradycardia.\n\nHDT induces an increase in central blood volume as supported by the central venous pressure and cardiac volume increase and in return, MSNA and heart rate decrease. These cardiovascular effects seem to be the same as the thermoneutral immersion and suggest that the ANS activation is the same during HDT and WI.\n\nNevertheless, a few previous studies about ANS in HDT indicate some discordant results: a sympathetic decrease was reported but several results show an increase of parasympathetic activity linked with a trend of increase of arterial baroreflex. The aim of this study is to assess ANS activity in HDT on different angles (-6\u00b0 and -15\u00b0) and WI. The investigators suppose an increase of parasympathetic activity during WI corresponding to parasympathetic activation during HDT especially at -6\u00b0."

                            "The National Space Biomedical Research Institute is interested in learning more about heart function in space. One potential problem with long duration, manned space flight is muscle loss- including loss of heart muscle. One goal of our research is to help identify why this muscle loss occurs. We are interested in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery because this procedure is performed to correct a problem with the valve that may also change heart function. This change in heart function may provide information that is useful in understanding and potentially preventing the loss of cardiac muscle in space.\n\nThree patient groups will be studied, patients having surgery for aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and coronary bypass. We are planing to perform this study on 30 patients, 10 in each group.\n\nThe aim of this study is to continue our ongoing study of the magnitude and predictors of the changes in size of the left ventricle following acute volume and pressure unloading as a ground-based analog for manned space flight."

                            "Among the most serious of the risks identified by NASA in the area of cardiovascular alterations are serious dysrhythmias and the development of orthostatic intolerance. Prolonged exposure to microgravity may lead to a reduction in cardiac performance, particularly during times of stress and that undiagnosed cardiovascular disease may manifest during long missions. The PI and colleagues have worked closely with NASA and NSBRI over the last six years to optimize use of ultrasound in the space program as an investigative modality, addressing fundamental cardiovascular problems in need of countermeasures development. We propose the following specific aim:\n\nTo continue our ongoing study of the magnitude and predictors of LV mass regression following acute volume and pressure unloading as a ground-based analog for manned spaceflight. This work will continue to focus on patients undergoing aortic valve surgery, but exploit recent knowledge of the roles of cytokines and integrins involved in cardiac hypertrophy and regression as well as emerging technologies such as gene chip analysis.\n\nThis work will be closely focused on risks and critical questions identified by the Cardiovascular Alterations Team as described in the Bioastronautics Critical Path Road Map Baseline Document. If successful, this project will enhance assessment of cardiac function during long duration missions and potentially suggest cytokine promoters or signal transduction pathways that could be targeted for cardiac atrophy countermeasures. In addition, we will continue to provide the facilities of our Core laboratory for access by investigators throughout the NASA and NSBRI programs in need of assistance in acquiring or analyzing ultrasonic data."

                            "Flight Analogs/Bed Rest Research Project (FA/BRRP) provides NASA with a ground-based research platform to complement space research. By mimicking on Earth the conditions of weightlessness experienced by the human body in space, NASA can test and refine scientific theories and procedures to develop countermeasures to protect humans from the effects of the space travel. The use of ground analogs, such as bed rest, are essential because access to the resources required to conduct studies in space is very limited, and the expense of studies significantly greater than those conducted using flight analogs. Future space exploration will challenge NASA to answer many critical questions about how humans can live and work for extended missions away from Earth.\n\nFlight analog testing is critical to NASA to validate countermeasures, given the few opportunities to use flight platforms as the Shuttle retires; also, the US has only 1-2 International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers per Expedition. The Flight Analogs/Bed Rest Research Project is one way NASA will devise ways to ensure astronaut safety and productivity on extended missions to the moon and Mars.\n\nIn the Flight Analogs Project (FAP), volunteers spend many days in a controlled research environment in the Flight Analog Research Unit (FARU) in Galveston, TX. In the current campaigns, volunteers will undergo three phases in the bedrest projects: 1) pre-bedrest baseline testing, 2) a bedrest phase, and 3) the recovery period. Bed rest results in many physiologic changes similar to those seen in astronauts. Pre bed rest is used to gather baseline data against which the bed-rest phase data will be compared. Researchers then monitor how the volunteers' bodies change over the course of the study and how quickly they recover once they are allowed to resume normal activities. Post bed rest is used to monitor recovery from bed rest. In longer campaigns, return to the unit for follow-up testing may be requested after 1, 3, 6, and/or 12 months.\n\nTHE COUNTERMEASURE AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING STUDY (CFT) will test the effectiveness of exercise on loss of muscle, bone and cardiovascular function. Participants will perform an exercise program in a system called the standalone Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator (sZLS), a \"vertical treadmill\" that removes the weight from the long axis of the body to simulate exercise as it is done in space. Resistance (weight lifting) exercise will be performed on special weight machines. Before and after 70 days of bedrest, participants will be tested on a corresponding set of physiological measures. Specific exercises and intensities are rotated such that each workout is different, with some days being heavier and some lighter. Results of the study will help understand which mission tasks might be affected by changes in physiology during space flight and design countermeasures to prevent or minimize impairment to these physiological systems\n\nThe ALTERNATE COMPRESSION GARMENT STUDY (ACG) will determine effectiveness of compression garments on regulating blood pressure and other body systems after extended periods of head-down bed rest. Participants in the experimental group will wear custom-fit compression garments and undergo evaluation on their response to an upright tilt test and a corresponding set of physiological measures before and after 14 days of bed rest. These participants will be compared to another group of participants who did not wear the compression garments. Results of the study will help scientists determine the time it takes for the cardiovascular system to re-adapt to upright posture, determine whether wearing compression garments during recovery is necessary to protect against dizziness and loss of consciousness often experienced after space missions, and determine the effect of wearing custom fit compression garments on the amount of time needed to readjust to a normal, upright posture."

                            "The human being has shown that he can live and work in the space environment, but due to the lack of essential mechanical load on muscle and bone, the fluid-shift as well as alterations in the acid-base balance (mainly on account of nutritional factors), the exposure to microgravity results in a gradual degradation of muscle, bone and cartilage, deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and metabolic changes. Countermeasures to prevent all the deconditioning of the physiological systems are not yet fully effective and require further investigation.\n\nA commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the human organism on ground is the 6\u00b0 head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning.\n\nOne of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context: supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting.\n\nDrawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation. Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the acidogenic properties need to be compensated. As previous works suggest, a shift of acid base balance into the acid direction and the resulting changes in bone and protein turnover may be hindered by supplementing alkaline mineral salts.\n\nIn this regard, a mid-term bed rest study was performed in order to investigate the effect of a combined whey protein (0.6 g/kg body weight/day) and potassium bicarbonate (90 mmol/day) supplementation as a potential countermeasure to multiple physiological and metabolic alterations on the human body resulting from real and simulated microgravity."

                            "Bone loss is not only a well-documented effect of spaceflight on astronauts, but also a condition that affects millions of men and women on Earth each year. Many countermeasures to bone loss have been proposed, and many have been evaluated to some degree. To date, those showing potential have focused on either exercise or pharmacological interventions, but none have targeted dietary intake alone as a factor to predict or minimize bone loss during spaceflight. The investigators proposed to document how the ratio of acid precursors to base precursors in the diet is related to directional changes in markers of bone resorption and formation during flight and recovery from flight. There is a high likelihood for success in predicting the extent of bone loss from dietary intake patterns of astronauts during spaceflight, given that this concept is strongly anchored in data obtained from ground-based experiments in our laboratory and others. The notion of manipulating diet to minimize bone loss could also have significant social and economic impacts for NASA and for the general public - especially given the increasing trends for diets that are high in animal protein and low in fruits and vegetables. The results of the proposed experiments will lead to development of a dietary countermeasure for bone loss consisting of a balanced diet with no associated risks for side effects that might be present with pharmaceuticals or supplements, no requirement for payload mass, and no additional crew time necessary during flight."

                            "Computers now play an important role in the lives of most individuals.Access to computers is crucial for people with disabilities and may improve their quality of life. The use of computers can facilitate mainstreaming at school, for example, and the Internet may provide a valuable means of communication. However, the use of computers requires a certain degree of motor ability. People with motor disabilities frequently experience difficulties using a standard keyboard and standard pointing input systems such as a mouse. Many solutions exist to facilitate computer access, depending on the person's specific impairments and the purpose for which the computer is used. The most common solution relies on the use of a virtual keyboard which is directly displayed on the computer screen. The selection of the desired key on the virtual keyboard can be handled by a large variety of input devices, from a microgravity mouse to single switch devices supplemented by a process of dynamic scanning of the keyboard.Although such assistive devices render computers accessible to people with disabilities, the actual inputting of text can be very slow. A method to increase text input speed is to display words which are predicted from the letters previously typed. Word prediction reduces the number of necessary key strokes by avoiding having to type the whole word. The effect on text input speed is, however uncertain and results in the literature are inconclusive. Indeed, word prediction software provide a enhancement of cognitive load which decrease text input speed.The reduction of cognitive load could therefore be based in part on the optimization settings of the software and / or achievement of a rehabilitation program.Our hypothesis are for people with spinal cord injury : i) optimization settings word prediction software and ii) a rehabilitation program could improve the text input speed.The investigators propose to study the influence of settings word prediction software on text input speed and the influence of a rehabilitation program provided by a therapist, focused on word prediction software to help integrate them. The aim is to increase the performance of people with spinal cord injury and their satisfaction.\n\nThe first phase of this research is to select the word prediction software and configuration that provides the best user support.The second phase corresponds to the objective of evaluating the efficiency of a rehabilitation program ."

Similarly, if the word prediction software has a capacity for self-improvement the internal dictionary, it will be disabled.\n\nthe investigators will study one setting of the configuration word prediction software. Are available the length of the list of proposals for which three options are selected: 1, 3 or 5 words, according to the literature and to the results of a questionnaire.This questionnaire was sent to identify the use of people with spinal cord injury and professionals about word prediction software.\n\nThe list of words is in the upper position of the screen based on the results of the questionnaire.\n\nFour combinations will be tested on each subject. Twelve Tetraplegics will be required in each group (one group using a virtual keyboard and one group using the physical keyboard) Each combination will be tried for 10 minutes.\n\nPHASE 2 :\n\nThe second phase will evaluate the effeciency of a rehabilitation program reduced cognitive load generated by the software predictions words.\n\nThe investigators propose an evaluation of the effects of 12 training sessions in a controlled, randomized, three parallel groups (experimental group : rehabilitation program, a group : a self-learning and a group : no learning).\n\nText input tests will be performed before and after the training sessions for people who have rehabilitation program. For the other two groups, those will be reviewed one month after the first test.\n\nFor this evaluation, a different text but with the same difficulty will be used. The order of execution will be randomized.\n\nAt the end of the month the three groups will be evaluated according to the same procedures for the firts test."

                            "Generating critical levels of power is a prerequisite for performing simple daily activities, such as rising from a chair or climbing stairs. For a young healthy person these activities can be performed easily, however after a prolonged period of forced inactivity (such as during the recovery from a sports injury, prolonged bed rest or spaceflight) a loss of muscle mass occurs. It has been suggested that this loss may be triggered by oxidative stress. An enzyme involved in the production of free radicals in various experimental models, including immobilization, is xanthine oxidase (XO). Although allopurinol is an inhibitor of XO widely used in clinical practice, its effect on the maintenance of muscle mass after an immobilization protocol is unknown. Thus, the major aim of this clinical trial is to determine the effect of allopurinol administration on the prevention of muscle mass loss in immobilized subjects.\n\nThis is a prospective, randomized study in which fifty young male subjects (aged between 25 and 40 years) diagnosed with grade II ankle sprain will be recruited. After immobilization the patients will be assigned randomly to one of two experimental groups, one treated with allopurinol (n=25) and the other with placebo (n=25). The dosage of allopurinol will be the same as recommended for gout patients, i.e. 300 mg/day orally, during all the immobilization period, which will last fifteen days. This medication will be delivered to the patients when they agree to participate in the clinical trial. They will be immobilized by posterior knee splint, preventing use of that leg.\n\nWe will determine muscle mass loss by performing two magnetic resonances of both legs before and after the immobilization period. We will also take two blood samples (before and after immobilization) to measure oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, and XO activity), inflammatory parameters (IL-6, C-reactive protein and 1-antichymotrypsin), as well as vitamin D levels."

                            "Experiments were conducted in a human centrifuge. The protocol aimed at mimicking a routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and included 10-min exposure to +1.4 - +3.5 Gz. Subjects were exposed three times to this sequence, breathing air, 44.5% O2 or 100% O2.\n\nTen volunteers wearing anti-G trousers participated in the study. The Ethics Committee Ile-de-France III and the French National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) approved the protocol (number 2009-A01092-55).\n\nThree different imaging techniques, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), pulmonary ultrasound and chest SPECT/CT were used and compared. EIT enabled ventilation monitoring in the human centrifuge, whereas pulmonary ultrasound and SPECT/CT gave functional and topographical information before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations. EIT analysis focused on regional ventilation, SPECT on global lung ventilation and perfusion, CT on the presence of atelectasis, and pulmonary ultrasound analysis looked for comet tails in 64 chest areas. Arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously by finger photoplethysmography. Cardiac output and stroke volume were computed from these recordings, using three different algorithms. Echocardiography was used as reference non-invasive technique for stroke volume determination and performed before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations."

The proposed research program takes a new approach which could lead to an effective, practical and acceptable protocol for preadapting astronauts to space flight. By using the gravito-inertial alterations possible with centrifugation in different body orientations the investigators will quantify an individual's sensory adaptation capability and use it to predict and to minimize the consequences of movement in any other gravity environment - eventually including weightlessness. The investigators will also study whether a drug (promethazine) affects motion perception and motion sickness."

They did this while experiencing centripetal acceleration equivalent to Earth gravity (1 Gz), and then hypogravity (0.5 Gz).

Subjects were repeatedly roll tilted to angles between 11 and 19 degrees, and then reported their perceived tilt angle using a subjective visual vertical task. They did this while experiencing centripetal acceleration equivalent to Earth gravity (1 Gz), and then hypogravity (0.5 Gz). We hypothesized that, after entering hypogravity, subjects would tend to underestimate their tilt angle. We calculated the percent change in their perception of tilt between 1 Gz and 0.5 Gz.",

Subjects sat on a motorized platform which repeatedly provided them with small motions to the left or right. After each motion subjects report whether they perceived a motion to the left or right. Based on subject responses, a psychometric curve fit is performed that determines the threshold (the standard deviation of the underlying cumulative Gaussian). Yaw rotation means rotations about an axis that is perpendicular to gravity.\n\nThis outcome measure applies only to arm 5 subjects.",

                            "A loss of body weight has been documented in lowland-living individuals when exposed to hypoxic environments, such as at high altitudes, or under laboratory conditions. This weight loss has been attributed both to a reduced appetite (and subsequent fall in dietary energy intake), and to an increase in resting energy expenditure. Interestingly, a reduction in appetite and energy intake has also been reported during space flight, although the mechanism for this has not been explained. As the gas inside future planetary habitats is likely to have lower partial pressure of oxygen than in Earth's atmospheric air, hypoxia induced appetite reduction could pose a challenge for individuals in these environments. For example, persistent under-eating could compromise long term health due to inadequate intake of essential micronutrients, especially in the presence of altered nutrient metabolism and requirements seen during space flight. Moreover, inadequate macronutrient intake could exacerbate the loss of lean body tissue which occurs in situations (such as microgravity, inactivity and bed rest) where muscles are unloaded. Indeed, a protein intake greater than normal could be required in situations where there is muscle inactivity, to achieve the same postprandial anabolic effect of amino acids seen in ambulatory individuals.\n\nThe mechanism for the reduction in appetite observed in hypoxia is not well established. Several incretin hormones and adipokines have been implicated in the control of appetite and may be candidates for inducing this alteration in appetite observed in hypoxia. However, reports in the literature present contradictory findings, perhaps due to the use of different experimental paradigms (hypobaric and normobaric hypoxia, active and resting subjects, variability in the degree and duration of hypoxia).\n\nThe protocol of the current study standardises physical activity, ambient temperature, hypoxic stimulus and nutritional composition of the diet, and aims to extend our knowledge of the effects of hypoxia and bedrest on appetite and its hormonal control.\n\nIn order to discern the separate and combined effects of microgravity and hypoxia, fourteen normal or over-weight men, who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited following medical and psychological screening. They will be invited to attend the Olympic Sport Centre, Planica, Slovenia on 3 occasions, with each visit being 31 days in duration and separated by 5 months. Each 31-day visit ('campaign') includes a baseline recording period (5 days), 21 days of intervention and a recovery period (5 days), with the 3 interventions allocated in a randomized, cross over design: i) Normobaric normoxic bed rest (NBR; FiO2=21%), ii) Normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB; FiO2=14%; ~4000 m simulated altitude), and iii) Normobaric hypoxic bed rest (HBR; FiO2=14%). A standardized, repeating, 14-day dietary menu, comprised of foods commonly consumed in the Slovenian diet, will be applied during all campaigns, the targeted energy intakes being calculated individually using a modified Benedict-Harris formula with physical activity factor multipliers of 1.2 for the HBR and NBR campaigns and 1.4 for the HAMB campaign. Food will be provided in weighed portions and subjects will be encouraged to eat all food supplied. However, any food not eaten will be weighed and actual amount consumed recorded in a diet analysis programme. Body mass will be assessed daily during the campaigns using a gurney incorporating load cells, and whole body composition will be determined before and immediately after each intervention using fan beam dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry.\n\nParticipants will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test before and on day 17 of each intervention period, in the morning, after a 12 hour fast, with the time of assessment replicated on each study day at every campaign. On arrival, participants will rest supine on a hospital bed and place their hand in a heated hand warming unit (air temperature 50-55oC). An intravenous cannula will then be inserted retrograde into a dorsal hand vein for arterialised-venous blood sampling. After 15mins rest, a baseline, fasting blood sample will be taken for determination of serum insulin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, adiponectin and leptin, whole blood glucose and lactate, and plasma catecholamines, ghrelin, PeptideYY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1), triglycerides, and non-esterified fatty acid concentration. An expired breath sample will be collected into evacuated tubes for 13 labelled carbon dioxide (13CO2) determination, and a 20min baseline measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) will be then made using indirect calorimetry, with subjects wearing a mask, and both inspired and expired air being measured on every breath. Appetite assessment will be made by asking subjects to rate their hunger, desire to eat, fullness, and their prospective food intake, by placing a vertical mark on a 0-100mm linear scale. This visual analogue scale will be measured from left to right, with 0 indicating no experience of the variable (e.g. not hungry, unable to eat anything) and 100 indicating the most of each variable that they can imagine experiencing (e.g. intense desire to eat, or completely full). Values for these 4 variables will be combined to calculate a combined appetite score (CAS). Once baseline measurements have been completed, subjects will consume a mixed nutrient milkshake (Ensure Plus, Abbott Nutrition) at 5ml/kg body weight, which will be supplemented (at 1% of carbohydrate content) with 13-Carbon labelled (13C) Glucose. Arterialised venous blood samples will subsequently be taken every 10min for glucose and lactate assessment, and every 20min for assessment of serum insulin and incretin hormones. A measurement of REE and RER will be performed in the last 15min of every 30min period for the following 2 hours to assess fuel oxidation and metabolic rate, and an expired breath sample will be collected into evacuated tubes for 13CO2 determination at a later date. Subjective appetite will be assessed every 15minutes throughout using visual analogue scales, as described above, and at the end of the 2hr postprandial period subjects will be given an ad libitum pasta-based test meal and will be instructed to eat until they feel comfortably full. This meal will be comprised of cooked dried white pasta, commercially available tomato-based pasta sauce, olive oil and grated hard cheese, with a composition of 37% of total energy derived from fat, 48% carbohydrate, and 16% protein. The amount eaten will be recorded and related to subjective appetite ratings."

                            "One of the major issues in space explorations is the negative effect of prolonged exposure to very low gravity (i.e. a condition often referred to as microgravity or weightlessness) on astronauts' health. In this unusual condition the human body undergoes an adaptation process, often referred to as \"deconditioning\", that leads to significant loss of bone and muscle mass, hormonal changes, as well as modifications of important cardiovascular parameters. While the new physiological state is adequate to the microgravity environment, it results unsuitable upon return on earth. Hence after the mission astronauts experience various health-related problems and must undertake an intense rehabilitation program. Cardiovascular deconditioning originates mainly from a shift of blood from the lower extremities to the upper part of the body caused by the absence of gravity. In the long term (i.e. days) this causes a loss of blood and body fluid. In the short term (i.e. minutes) it elicits modifications to arterial blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nIn this study, funded by the European Union through the project STAMAS, we intend to evaluate whether leg physical exercises can lead to a displacement of blood towards the lower extremities, therefore ameliorating the upward fluid shift caused by weightlessness. More generally, we aim to investigate the short-term response of the cardiovascular system to leg exercises in microgravity-like conditions. After a clear understanding of these phenomena we will develop a controller that, by monitoring the physiological stare of a subject, will compute the appropriate exercise regime to stabilize his/her cardiovascular parameters to desired safe values. Our contribution will provide a better understanding of the cardiovascular system, and will delineate the physiological ground for the development of novel countermeasure devices against the cardiovascular deconditioning during space flight based on continuous leg exercises.\n\nThe protocol we propose in this document presents minimal risks for our potential subjects, while has the potential to produce important contributions. The cardiovascular parameters we intend to analyse are: blood pressure, heart rate and leg blood volume. These signals will be acquired non-invasively and with minimal risks. Leg exercises will be performed by means of a stepping device (MARCOS) previously developed in our Lab. MARCOS enables to vary the resistance applied against knee-extension movements, and therefore it allows a systematic evaluation of different exercise intensities. Finally, microgravity conditions can be easily emulated by letting the subjects lay on a tilted platform with head-down (i.e. head-down bed rest - HDBR, or head-down tilt - HDT) during the exercise sessions, thus inducing a shift of body fluid toward the thorax. The most effective inclination angle has proved to be as low as -6\u00b0, thus constituting only minimal risks for the subjects. In practice, subjects will comfortably lay on the negatively tilted platform and will perform stepping at different intensities while their cardiovascular parameters are being monitored and recorded in encrypted form for subsequent analysis."

                            "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of LOFT Therapy in breast cancer survivors. In a previous study, the investigators found that many patients are more debilitated at diagnosis than previously recognized. Both chemotherapy and anti-estrogen therapy have a large effect. Within 6 months patients replace muscle with fat leading to a significant reduction in muscle power and endurance. Our data suggests that common exercise recommendations for at least 150 minutes of exercise a week would be far beyond many of our patients' physical ability after therapy, leading to the soreness, injury, frustration, and early discontinuation (or failure to initiate an exercise program in the first place). The degree of muscle loss seen in our patients is similar to that documented in US astronauts after long-term space flight. Our collaborator Dr. Yvonne Cagle, retired USAF flight surgeon, noted that the cosmonauts were in better shape (had less muscle atrophy) than the astronauts. This difference was more than could be explained by the rigorous Russian exercise program. The only key distinction was the compressive, \"penguin suits\" used by the Russians. This observation lead Dr. Cagle to develop a technique called low intensity, off loaded-compressive therapy (LOFT) to replicate the impact of the Russian penguin suits for patients who were debilitated, whether by space flight or by chronic conditions such as arthritis, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. The LOFT method does not require excessive exertion or strain on the joints. In field observations, LOFT therapy improved muscle strength, muscle mass, endurance, sleep quality, and fatigue. This pilot study is the first to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and biologic impact of LOFT on breast cancer survivors."

The investigators will also explore the relationship of the LOFT intervention to changes in insulin resistance, growth hormone levels, body mass index, patient reported physical activity, fatigue, and overall quality of life.\n\nPrimary Objective Evaluate the safety and feasibility of LOFT training in breast cancer survivors (< 3 years from diagnosis) treated with either chemotherapy and/or anti-estrogen therapy.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nEstimate the effect size of LOFT training on muscle power, endurance, daily activity, fatigue, and quality of life.\nEstimate the effect of short-term LOFT training on biochemical parameters of inflammation, metabolism, anabolic hormone secretion, and bone turnover.\n\nLOFT Therapy\u2122 Summary LOFT Therapy\u2122 is a form of exercise that requires less energy for movement. LOFT Therapy\u2122 will be performed 2 times a week for 4 weeks a total of 8 sessions. The patient will be wrapped with fabric cuffs, on up to four limbs. The cuffs are applied to the widest part of the biceps and upper thighs at pressures between 80-100 mmHg with minimal venous encroachment. The patients will ride a recumbent bike for 18 total minutes of sub-maximal exertion (up to 70% repetition maximum ), with the option of up to 2 periods of 15-second higher intensity exertions as tolerated, followed by individualized respiratory recovery periods determined by the relative decrease in breathing effort.\n\nThe 18-minute session will be preceded by a two-minute compression check, where the wraps will be adjusted based on any signs or symptoms of nerve or vessel impingement. Patients will undergo an intake and outtake assessment with each session to collect subjective data and patient feedback. Two compression sessions will be conducted for 4 weeks, for a total of 8 sessions.\n\nThis study will enroll 15 patients. A 20% dropout rate for this group was taken into consideration so the investigators assume analysis will be done on at least 12 patients."

                            "Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which free-fall (0G) can be created long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition to the 0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present another unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.\n\nIt is well known that performance decrements occur in astronauts during and after gravity level transitions. Illusions are commonly felt in orbit as well disorientation and perceptual limitations, mainly due to both psycho-physiological changes and adaptation and lack of familiar points of reference in the space environment. Studies performed during previous space missions showed several changes occurring in different gravity conditions, pointing out, for example, that colors and shadows were misleading, the depth and distance perception were weakened, and the linear perspective was lost. Visual perception is of primary importance for spatial orientation and object recognition because the static vestibular (otolithic) and proprioceptive signals are absent when free-floating. Consequently, astronauts become increasingly dependent on vision to perceive motion and orientation. All these factors play an important role in the adaptation of humans to spaceflight that needs to be analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate human psycho-physiological adaptive process to changing gravity. Human psycho-physiological health has to be safeguarded and possibly improved when long-term human space missions are programmed in the near future.\n\nThe primary objective of this experiment is to investigate if the SWI illusion is present in altered gravity environments. Since weight cannot be estimated in 0G, investigators have developed a procedure during which the subject is asked to estimate the objects' mass by shaking them rather than lifting them. Our results in 1G indicate that a size-mass illusion (SMI) is also present in 1G. Our hypothesis is that the previously observed alteration in 3D visual perception in 0G, particularly in the height of 3D objects, as well as the change in proprioceptive inputs, will be responsible for changes in the SMI in 0G and 1.8G compared to 1G. In a separate proposal, investigators will also propose to perform this experiment using the ESA short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC), with subjects exposed to various centrifugal force levels, to further investigate the role of proprioceptive cues in the size-mass illusion."

                            "Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which weightlessness (0G) can be created long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition to the 0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present another unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.\n\nCognitive function, together with good oculomotor control, eye-hand coordination, and spatial orientation perception, is a critical subsystem that is used by the CNS in the control of vehicles and other complex systems in a high-level integrative function. Evidence from space flight research demonstrates that the function of each of these subsystems is altered by the transitions in gravito-inertial force levels. These neuro-vestibular alterations, unfortunately, correspond to mission phases where physical and cognitive performance are particularly critical for crew safety and mission success. To date, there is only limited operational evidence that these alterations cause functional impacts on mission-critical vehicle (or complex system) control capabilities. However, the true operational risks will be estimable only after the investigators have filled the knowledge gaps and when the investigators can accurately assess integrated performance in off-nominal operational settings.\n\nAccurate perception of self-in-space motion and self-motion relative to other objects are critical to piloting, driving, and remote manipulator operations. Immediately after space flight, most crewmembers have reported some degree of disorientation/perceptual illusion, often accompanied by nausea (or other symptoms of motion sickness), and frequently manifested by lack of coordination, particularly during locomotion. Despite recent, intensive training, some Shuttle landings were outside of the desired performance boundaries. Scores indicating neurovestibular dysfunction in returning astronauts generally correlated with poorer flying performances, including a lower approach and landing shorter, faster, and harder. An underestimation of distance, coupled to an overestimation of tilt magnitude or misperception of the type of motion, could be at the origin of these poorer performances.\n\nThis study should confirm that the unloading of the otoliths in weightlessness induces an alteration in the egocentric reference during space flight. Errors in egocentric localization might contribute at a higher level to the computation of misleading world-centered representations, and therefore be partly responsible for illusory sensations and motion sickness symptoms during space flight, and postural instability and oscillopsia after returning in a reduced or terrestrial gravitational force level.\n\nBeside their fundamental implications, the results of this study have also practical implications in the design of man-machine interfaces. Changes in judgment of distance in microgravity or in reduced gravity affect crew posture and reach, display orientation, and other visual cues, which should be considered in hardware and operations design."

                            "Previous studies have neglected two important aspects for the China National Space Administration. First, while biomechanical models are very sensitive to the characteristics of the subjects, data have been collected on subjects with biomechanical characteristics very different from those of \"typical\" Chinese astronauts. Second, pure video analysis techniques and kinematic data lack the necessary acceleration information important to understanding the forces exerted during movement and control of human motion. While some studies used force and moment sensors to aid in robot torque control and human joint work estimation, investigators are unaware of any studies performed in a microgravity environment that have combined the kinetic force and moment information with acceleration measurements to enable more reliable motion tracking without the need for acceleration estimation.\n\nThis is why MICR0-G sensors and accompanying kinematic video system have been developed in order to provide for detailed analyses of the astronaut movement control strategy (joint forces and torques, kinetic and acceleration measurements). Knowledge of the joint torques permits us to calculate the joint and musculoskeletal dynamics required to execute the microgravity motions, as well to provide insight into the altered movement strategies in reduced gravity as compared to 1-G locomotion."

                            "Alongside a well-known physiological deconditioning, such as a decrease in muscle mass or bone demineralization, extended stays in weightlessness also cause cognitive dysfunction. However, the studies on this subject during space missions short or long term could not determine how these cognitive dysfunction resulted from a direct effect of weightlessness or a stress-related effect.\n\nAnalysis of electro-encephalography (EEG) using a standardized mapping method is used to study the changes of operation of the cerebral cortex as the near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a reflection of changes in the cerebral hemodynamics. Their combined use is a relatively simple and economical method for studying brain changes in an environment where the normal brain imaging techniques can not be used.\n\nThe main objective of this experiment is to evaluate the alterations in brain cortical activity and brain oxygenation level induced by micro- and hypergravity conditions."

                            "3-D Ballistocardiography (BCG) recording was performed in microgravity during the Spacelab D2 missions on a single astronaut. The results from this experiment have been published in the literature: the influence of respiration have been demonstrated and the signal processing methodology for the reconstruction of the displacement in one cardiac cycle have been developed. A 3D-BCG sensor has been developed and a collaboration to perform a sustained microgravity experiment onboard the Russian segment of ISS has been initiated. To be integrated in the PNEUMOCARD device, this new sensor needs to be tested in microgravity before implemented on ISS.\n\nThe aim of the present parabolic flight study is to serve as a feasibility demonstrator and test bed in order to evaluate the feasibility of 3D-BCG in sustained microgravity and to test whether the sensitivity of the developed 3D-BCG sensor is appropriate"

The investigators will compare the intersection of the horizontal and vertical saccadic trajectories (jerky) with the apparent direction of the right-front indicated by the subjects when they look right front in the dark (LOOK) and that they indicate when they determine whether a visual target through the right-front apparent (PERCEPTION).

                            "As a direct consequence of exposure to microgravity, astronauts experience a number of physiological changes which can lead to serious medical implications. Most immediate and significant is the headward shift of body fluids and the removal of gravitational loading from bone and muscles, resulting in progressive changes of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. The cardiovascular systems is subject to rapid changes which has been demonstrated in studies of short term (shuttle) and long term missions to Skylab and MIR.\n\nOur main hypothesis is that there is a linear relationship between the gravity level (0G, 0.16G, 0.38G, 1G, 1.8G) and the cardiovascular parameters (heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure and blood pressure variability (BPV) as well the spectral analysis of HRV and BPV."

This experiment now will complete the data set-up obtained during the MARS500 study on how these respective individuals will re-act to highly physically and emotionally challenging situations during a parabolic flight.\n\nThis add-on experiment to MARS500 will enable answering to the following questions i) if the stress response systems - when compared for two conditions but in the same individuals - do react uniformly and ii) if those subjects prone to have adequate stress response pattern will show gradually less immune modulation effects.\n\nThe understanding of the complex interactions of stress and immunity under chronic and acute stress conditions might help to enable adequate health and immune monitoring and might as well suggest suitable countermeasures for the prevention of the unwanted immunological effects during long-term confinement and space missions."

For that purpose, kinematic and neuromuscular parameters under microgravity are compared to normal gravity conditions. To induce postural responses among the test subjects, an electromagnetic maneuverable postural platform will be used in order to randomly elicit perturbations. Postural reactions will be quantified by means of mechanical and electromyographic data. In Addition, peripheral nerve stimulation will be used to assess the spinal excitability by means of H-reflex recordings. H-reflex measurements were chosen as they allow reliable information about inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms taking place at the spinal level."

                            "In this project, investigators propose to study the jump in different reduced gravity fields obtained during parabolic flights profiles but also during increased gravity fields obtained during turns of the airplane or during the pull-up phase of the parabola. By means of a pneumatic device, an additional pull-down force will be added to the vertical force caused by the gravity field. By combining different levels of gravity to different levels of the added pull-down force it will be possible to dissociate the respective contribution of the otolithic and proprioceptive systems to the anticipatory landing response. To the investigators' knowledge, only one study has modified the gravity field during a jump. However, these authors did not add a pull-down force and only analyzed the vertical ground reaction force.\n\nA better knowledge of the sensory-motor control of the landing phase of a jump will also increase the investigators' understanding of the physiopathology of joint instability. Indeed, similarities could be found between the evolution of the motor response due to the absence gravity during long-duration space flights and the pathological process of chronic ankle and knee instability. The knowledge generated by this study will thus provide invaluable information in the context of human performance and rehabilitation."

                            "Investigations description ----------------------------------\n\nDuring the experiments, subjects will jump in different gravity fields while submitted to an additional pull-down force equal to 0-100% of their body weight on Earth. During the takeoff and landing phases of the jumps, the ground reaction force will be recorded by a force-platform, the movements of the limb segments will be recorded by means of a high-speed camera and the electrical activity (EMG) of the main lower limb muscles will be recorded by means of surface electrodes.\n\nForce platform and Subject Loading System We have developed a device that combines a force platform on which the subject jumps and a Subject Loading System (SLS) that pulls the subject downwards.\n\nThe force platform is a 60 cm x 40 cm aluminum plate equipped with four force-transducers that measure the three components of the force exerted by the subject's feet on the ground.\n\nThe SLS consists in two pneumatic pistons, which are attached to a harness on one end and to the aluminum plate on the other. The SLS can be set to generate a force equal to 20-100% of the subject's body weight on Earth.\n\nA security handrail (not shown on the picture) is attached to the aluminum plate, around the force-platform in case of unbalance of the subject.\n\nEMG EMG will be recorded with a MyoSystem 1400L using surface electrodes. The skin will be shaved (if necessary) and the electrodes will be attached with double sided tape and plaster. The electrodes will be placed at the level of the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus, and on the thigh at the level of the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and lateral hamstrings and medial hamstrings. There will be 2 electrodes per muscle (fixed one against the other) and one reference electrode placed at the level of the C7 vertebra.\n\nManufacturer: Noraxon. Conformity certificate: CE 344\n\nVideo Movements of the subject will be recorded by means of a high-speed digital camera (Basler). In order to facilitate video analysis, 7 reflective markers (hemisphere with a 12 mm diameter) will delimit body segments: 3 will be glued on one shoe, 3 will be fixed on the skin (with the same method used for EMG electrodes) at the level of the ankle, knee, hip of one limb and the last one will be fixed on the neck.\n\nExperimental protocol\n\n----------------------------\n\nBefore flight subjects will be familiarized with the setup and the protocol. For each flight day, one subject will be studied. The procedure will be the following on all 3 days.\n\nThe experiment day starts at 7.30 a.m. with the test subject equipped with EMG electrodes and video markers. After take-off and after work is permitted, the subject goes to the experimental area where it is equipped with the SLS harness. Before each parabola, the subject stands beside the platform to adjust the zero level of the sensor (about 3 second). Then the subject steps on the platform to record his weight (about 3 second).\n\nDuring the hypergravity initial part in of the parabola, the subject is standing with is two feet on each side of the platform. The traction system is loose (5 kg traction). During the injection, the traction system starts to progressively pull downwards on the subject. The traction force is tuned between 20% and 100% of body weight on Earth. The traction force is constant during each parabola. During the 20 second of weightlessness or partial gravity, the subject jumps several times. At the end of the parabola, the subject puts his feet at the side of the platform and the traction system stops to pull downwards before the pull out phase.\n\nThis experiment will also be performed during periods of increased gravity obtained during turns of the airplane. Three turns per flight should be performed at 3 levels of gravity: 1.2, 1.4 g and 1.6 g.\n\nDuring each parabola or turn, one experimenter is taking care of the control of the traction system and of the collection of the data, a second one takes care of the image acquisition, and a third one takes care of the modification of the configuration of the harness between the parabolas and of the safety of the subject in case of unbalance during the parabolas or during the turn."

Fourteen non-obese men, who are otherwise healthy, will undergo 3x 21-day interventions; normobaric normoxic bed rest (NBR; FiO2=21%), normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB; FiO2=14%; ~4000 m simulated altitude), and normobaric hypoxic bed rest (HBR; FiO2=14%). The effects of hypoxia and bedrest on bone metabolism and phosphor-calcic homeostasis will be assessed (before and during each intervention, and 14 days after each intervention period) using venous blood sampling, 24hr urine collections, and peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT)."

                            "The risk of bone loss in response to immobilization and space flight is widely recognized, with such bone losses occurring predominantly in the legs. Loading forces in the lower extremities are typically low in space and during bed rest, but musculoskeletal loading countermeasures can prevent or reduce bone losses induced in these conditions. Although the primary origin may be of a mechanical nature, bone losses in astronauts and immobilized patients are likely to be modulated by the endocrine and the internal environment.\n\nBone loss and osteoporosis is also prevalent in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The most discussed etiological factors for this condition include lack of physical activity, vitamin-D deficiency, hypogonadism, use of corticosteroids and smoking. However, COPD is associated with tissue hypoxemia and it is unclear whether hypoxia per se will affect bone turnover or metabolism.\n\nThe protocol of the current study standardises potential confounding factors, such as physical activity, ambient temperature, hypoxic stimulus and nutritional composition of the diet across all 3 interventions, and aims to extend our knowledge of the effects of hypoxia and bedrest on bone metabolism and phospho-calcic homeostasis.\n\nFourteen non-obese men, who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited following medical and psychological screening. They will be invited to attend the Olympic Sport Centre, Planica, Slovenia on 3 occasions, with each visit being 31 days in duration and separated by 5 months. Each 31-day visit ('campaign') includes a baseline recording period (5 days), 21 days of intervention, and a recovery period (5 days), with a follow-up visit being carried out 14 days after each intervention. The 3 interventions will be allocated in a randomized, cross over design: i) Normobaric normoxic bed rest (NBR; FiO2=21%), ii) Normobaric hypoxic ambulatory confinement (HAMB; FiO2=14%; ~4000 m simulated altitude), and iii) Normobaric hypoxic bed rest (HBR; FiO2=14%). A standardized, repeating, 14-day dietary menu, comprised of foods commonly consumed in the Slovenian diet, will be applied during all campaigns. Targeted energy intakes will be calculated individually using a modified Benedict-Harris formula, with physical activity factor multipliers of 1.2 for the HBR and NBR campaigns and 1.4 for the HAMB campaign, used to promote energy balance. Body mass will be monitored daily during the campaigns using a gurney incorporating load cells, and whole body composition will be determined before and immediately after each intervention using fan beam dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry. Macronutrient composition of the diet will be approximately 17% protein, 53% carbohydrate and 30% fat, with >1.1g of protein per kg body weight provided per day, and daily salt (sodium chloride) intake being <10g. Food will be provided in weighed portions and subjects will be encouraged to eat all food supplied. However, any food not eaten will be weighed and actual amount consumed recorded in a diet analysis programme.\n\nParticipants will have bone mineral content assessed at 5 time points (before, 3 during and one after each intervention) using pQCT scans of the calf and thigh. Horizontal scans will be taken at 4%, 14%, 38%, and 66% of the tibia (assessed from its distal end), and at 4% and 33% of the femur. Twenty-four hour urine collections will be obtained before (2 time points), during (11 time points) and after (3 time points) each intervention, and will be assessed for urinary calcium and phosphate content, and for a marker of bone reabsorption (N-terminal telopeptide). In addition, early morning, fasting venous blood samples will also be taken before (2 time points), and during (5 time points) each intervention. These will be analysed for calcium, phosphate, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, Procollagen-I-N-terminal propeptide and regulators of bone metabolism, (Dickkopf-related protein 1 and Sclerostin)."

Specifically, the 3 tested hypotheses are:\n\nParabolic flight induces changes in hippocampal structure;\nWeightlessness induces changes in cognitive performance, and specifically spatial cognition;\nThere is a correlation between changes in hippocampal structure and changes in visuo-spatial memory performance.\nThere is a correlation between changes in hippocampal structure and changes in key neurotrophins.\n\nThe hypothesis tested during the preliminary experiment is that body posture affects the changes in spatial cognition performance."

Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011). Arterial hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, smoking, diabetes and family history represent the main cardiovascular risk factors. Arteriosclerosis leads to coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular insufficiency and peripheral vascular diseases that reflect in myocardial infarction and stroke.\n\nThe main objective of this experiment is to investigate the differential effect of microgravity on central aortic blood pressure.\n\nThe main criterion is the central aortic pressure (measured in mmHg). The hypothesis is that microgravity leads to an increased central aortic pressure."

                            "The findings from water immersion indicated that some motor tasks, such as plantarflexion (25), but not others, such as the leg-press (7), appear to be affected. Thus, it would be relevant to test a number of motor tasks and body regions. On the other hand, parabolic flight requires that methodologies can be performed in a quick efficient fashion. Hence, we propose examining ankle plantarflexion, leg-press and grip-force.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that plantarflexion MVC will be reduced in the microgravity phase of parabolic flight.\n\nAs secondary parameters will be assessed parameters of muscle function that can be easily implemented in parabolic flight, such as electromyography and ultrasound measurements of the musculotendinous unit. To assess the muscular system more deeply, for plantarflexion superimposed twitches will be performed (16) during MVC and at rest. An additional experimental condition placing foam (unstable surface; standard size) under the foot during plantarflexion will be included. This approach increases the challenge for the neuromuscular control system and, under such conditions, MVC is reduced (29).\n\nThese secondary investigations, which do not prohibitively complicate the practical implementation of the project, will help to understand what is happening in the musculature should we indeed find impediments of muscle force generation in microgravity.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability of high-load resistance training as a countermeasure for long term space flights, the current project has two scientific goals.\n\nThe main objective is to perform a deeper examination of muscle function and MVC in weightlessness (parabolic flight).\n\nThe secondary objective is to gather further insight into the underlying mechanisms and structures based on investigations targeting the neuromuscular and musculotendinous systems and their interaction.\n\nThe main judgment criteria is the MVC tested during three different tasks: (1) leg press, (2) plantarflexion and (3) grip strength.\n\nAs secondary criteria, we will assess parameters of muscle function that can be easily implemented in parabolic flight:\n\nRate of force development\nElectromyographic activity\nUltrasound measure: fascicle length and pennation angle of the gastrocnemius medialis muscle\nSuperimposed twitch torque (M-waves at rest and V-waves in MVC conditions)\nMaximum voluntary activation capacity (%VA): %VA = (1-[torque superimposed twitch/torque resting twitch])*100%.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that plantarflexion and knee extension force generation capacity will be reduced, but not grip-force, in the microgravity phase of parabolic flight."

                            "Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which weightlessness (0G) can be created long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition to the 0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present another unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.\n\nSpatial orientation perception is a critical subsystem that is used by the central nervous system in the control of vehicles and other complex systems in a high-level integrative function. Evidence from space flight research demonstrates that spatial orientation is altered by the transitions in gravito-inertial force levels (Cl\u00e9ment 2011; Cl\u00e9ment & Reschke 2008), transitions corresponding to mission phases particularly critical for crew safety and mission success. Accurate perception of self-in-space motion and self-motion relative to other objects is critical for successful operations that involve motor control e.g. doing an extra-vehicule activity or piloting the spacecraft. To date, there is only limited operational evidence that these alterations cause functional impacts on mission-critical operations and control capabilities. Immediately after space flight, most crewmembers have reported some degree of disorientation/perceptual illusion, often accompanied by nausea (or other symptoms of motion sickness), and frequently manifested by lack of coordination, particularly during locomotion The hypothesis is that alteration in sensorimotor performance induced by inverted vision is gravity depend: maximum alteration during hypergravity, intermediary alteration during normal gravity, minimal alteration during weightlessness."

                            "Under conditions of simulated microgravity, it is well known that normal cellular processes of vascular cells are altered. While these studies provide important information about these alterations in cells, it is likely not a complete picture due to the limitations of ground based simulated microgravity. It is our hypothesis that real microgravity, as is experienced in space, will reveal changes in EC and SMC phenotype and function that alters cell-cell communication. The study team will test our hypothesis by culturing mature endothelial cells, as well as stem cell derived endothelial cells, and mature smooth muscle cells in low Earth orbit (LEO) on the International Space Station (ISS) U.S. National Laboratory. The specific aims the Study team have proposed are the following:\n\nSpecific Aim #1: Preflight isolation and characterization of circulating stem cell derived endothelial cells. Specifically, the Study team will isolate CSCs from whole blood then direct them down an EC pathway. Once differentiated the study team will characterize their phenotype.\n\nSpecific Aim #2: Culture mature ECs, SMCs, and CSC derived ECs under conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO) aboard the ISS. Specifically, The study team will use advanced flight hardware to establish an active cell culture on the ISS. The cells will be cultured for a duration of 3 and 10 days, at which time the cells will be frozen for subsequent analysis. Simultaneously, the study team will culture the same populations in a ground based microgravity simulator as well as a normal gravity control.\n\nSpecific Aim #3: Assess the morphologic and genetic changes in cells after 3 and 10 days of space flight. Specifically, upon return to Earth, a transcriptome analysis will be completed from the frozen cell samples to assess changes in the cells molecular machinery.\n\nThis proposed study builds upon the abundant literature, including our own, surrounding the effects of ground based simulated microgravity on vascular endothelial cells. However, the study team include the less studied populations of smooth muscle cells and stem cell derived ECs. The goal of this work is to leverage conditions on the ISS, a powerful one-of-a-kind microgravity research platform in low Earth orbit, to study these cells and their cellular processes as it relates to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular deconditioning. This work seeks to reveal currently unknown changes in vascular cell health that lead to these diseases. The impact of this work is broad and can lead to new treatment options for millions of people who suffer from CVD including neointimal hyperplasia."

                            "This study is a collaboration between the Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences (CHAPS) and the Sleep and Brain Plasticity Centre (Department of Neuroimaging) at King's College London and the Sleep Disorders Centre at Guy's Hospital.The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of a 7 day unloading period (simulating micro gravity) on muscle mass using three independent methods\u037e two scanning techniques (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)) and one that involves swallowing a capsule that contains a harmless chemical called creatine (D3-Creatine (D3-cr)) and then measuring its concentration in urine. In order to induce muscle loss, participants will be required to lie flat on their back on a water bed filled with water and salt (called hyper-buoyancy flotation (HBF)). As this situation is similar to that experienced in space, the investigators will also measure the effect of HBF on sleep, brain and physiological function - all things known to change in astronauts. Sixteen male subjects (18-40 yrs) will be recruited to participate in the study that will require physiological testing before, during and following both 7 days of normal conditions and 7 days of HBF bed-rest. Each subject will be exposed to the same conditions and assessments over the study period. As some loss of muscle is expected, participants will be offered an exercise rehabilitation programme upon completion of HBF with self-monitored and/or guided sessions based on those provided by the Space Medicine Office of the European Space Agency to returning astronauts."

                            "The rapid loss of skeletal muscle occurs in extreme physiological conditions, most notably within intensive care, hypoxia and during spaceflight. The cause of this accelerated loss is unknown; however, interventions aiming to slow the decline may have profound effects on quality of life post-surgery and, in space expedition terms, the ability to complete mission critical tasks. In addition, the current methodologies available to measure total skeletal muscle mass have limitations, lack accuracy (anthropometry and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)) or are immobile and costly (dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)).\n\nThe primary aim of this study is to investigate whole body skeletal muscle loss induced through 7 consecutive days of whole-body immobilisation using three independent methods; dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and D3-Creatine dilution (D3-cr). A number of secondary aims are also targeted, which have the shared objective to measure the impact of 7-days of immobilisation on HBF; 1. Muscular, neuromuscular and cardiovascular adaptation; 2. Neurophysiology, sleep architecture and cognition; 3. A range of spaceflight specific measures, aiming to characterise the intervention proposed within this study (hyper-buoyancy flotation (HBF) bed rest) as an alternative ground-based analogue to observe the physiological response to microgravity.\n\nThe muscular, neuromuscular and cardiovascular research is performed by King's College London Centre of Human & Aerospace Physiological Sciences (KCL CHAPs) and ranges from measurement of whole-body change, to cellular adaptation. Total skeletal muscle mass will be measured using DXA, MRI and D3-cr as well as the cross-sectional area of a single muscle group (quadriceps) using ultrasound. A biopsy will be taken from the same muscle group (quadriceps) in order to investigate changes in muscle protein synthesis (MPS), myofibre size, force and protein: DNA ratio. Muscle performance will also be measured, from whole-body power output using a countermovement jump, to force expressed by the trunk, quadriceps, calf and handgrip. Muscle tone will be measured in three flexor and three extensor muscles in the calf, forearm and lower back. The plantarflexion muscles in the calf will be further assessed, with ankle proprioception, maximal strength and surface EMG of the medial gastrocnemius measured. Blood samples will be taken in order to distinguish changes in immunity and bone markers. The subject's height will be measured and intervertebral disc morphology distinguished using ultrasound and MRI.\n\nThe neuromuscular and muscle performance measurements will be obtained concurrently. Electrical activity produced by the skeletal muscles will be recorded and evaluated using electromyography (EMG). Prior to the force expression of the quadriceps being tested, pads will also be positioned for the muscle to be electrically stimulated and for a maximal involuntary force to be measured. Lastly, a cycle ergometer assessment will be undertaken, where power is ramped gradually and maximal aerobic utilisation (VO2max) determined.\n\nThe neurophysiology, sleep architecture and cognition investigation will be in collaboration with the Sleep and Brain Plasticity Centre (Department of Neuroimaging, IoPPN) and the Sleep Disorders Centre at Guy's Hospital. This study will look at any ensuing changes in sleep architecture and neurophysiology. Any associated cognitive or brain structural changes, which may be induced through 1 week of whole-body immobilisation, will also be investigated.\n\nThe procedures outlined are designed to assess known physiological adaptations occurring as a consequence of a micro-gravity environment, and therefore prove useful comparative tools from which the HBF model can be evaluated.\n\nSixteen male subjects (18-40 yrs) will be recruited to undertake test procedures pre- and post- a 7-day control period, where they will continue their habitual activities and be provided with their total (controlled) calorie intake, and pre- and post- a 7-day unloading period, where subjects will be required to remain on a hyper-buoyancy flotation (HBF) bed."

The following parameters are derived from the oscillation acceleration signal generated by the mechanical impulse in real time by the Myoton's software: 1) Dynamic stiffness: which indicates the resistance to deformation of a tissue, 2) Oscillation frequency: which indicates the (muscle) tone or intrinsic tension of a tissue, 3) The logarithmic decrement of the oscillation: which characterises tissue elasticity.",

                            "Although most ground studies showed that an egocentric reference frame better supports spatial orientation, it is not proven it will be the same during weightlessness.\n\nAlthough it might justify that visuomotor performance will be better supported by egocentric target cueing under altered gravity conditions, the fact that exocentric target cueing induces less head movements and called for least attentional and physiological workload could be the key factors for a more efficient task localization process. Moreover, weightlessness can induce spatial disorientation, which can be additionally influenced by the intrinsic and extrinsic spatial reference frames (Gurfinkel et al., 1993; Glasauer & Mittelst\u00e4dt, 1997, 1998; Harm et al., 1998; Lipshits et al. 2005). We expect that during weightlessness the workload will be the key factor and thus we hypothesize that an exocentric target cueing will outperform egocentric target cueing.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, and find out which presentation scheme for target cueing (EGO, EXO, ED) contributes most to an efficient visual search, performance to a visuomotor task will be evaluated during parabolic flights in normogravity (1g), hypergravity (1.8g) and microgravity (0g). The visuomotor performance will be assessed by a multi-directional tapping task as defined by ISO9241-9, which requests for motor responses by aimed pointing movements. Besides analyzing the pointing performance, different workload indices will be additionally assessed to evaluate the effort spent on visuomotor coordination. The attentional workload will be evaluated by the performance of a secondary task (visual reaction-time task), which needs to be conducted in parallel to the visuomotor task. Furthermore, the workload will be also assessed subjectively by the NASA TLX rating scale and physiologically, by analyzing the heart rate variability (HRV)."

Focus is on lung tissue compression, ventilation and regional perfusion. In addition, the influence of hypobaria on these parameters is assessed.\n\nThis study is conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee Ile-de-France III (ref. 3274) and the French National Agency for Drug Safety ANSM have approved the protocol (ref. ID RCB 2015-A00485-44 and ANSM 151046B-32).\n\nPrimary aim, item 1: Experiments are conducted in a human centrifuge. The protocol mimics a routine peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and includes 1hr05 min at +1Gz followed by 10-min exposure to +1.4 to +3.5Gz . Subjects are exposed three times to this sequence, breathing at positive pressure levels of 0, 5 or 10 hPa. Two groups of sixteen healthy male non-smoking volunteers, wearing anti-G trousers, are studied and compared: group 1 breathes air, group 2 100% O2.\n\nPrimary aim, item 2: Experiments are conducted in a hypobaric chamber. Sixteen healthy male non-smoking volunteers are exposed to four conditions: 0 or 15,000 ft altitude, breathing air or 100%O2. Protocol duration is 1h15min. Positive breathing pressure can be applied depending on the results of the experiments of item 1.\n\nSecondary aim: Experiments are conducted in a human centrifuge. Sixteen healthy male non-smoking volunteers are exposed to four conditions: uninflated or inflated anti-G trousers (175 hPa), +1 or +3.5 Gz for 3 min."

Data acquisition for both experiments will occur in the Astronaut Quarantine Facility (\"AQF\") at Johnson Space Center (JSC). Experimental methods and cognitive outcomes will be the same as those used in the pilot investigation titled Develop and Implement Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut Sleep Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (Phase I).

                            "The NASA /JSC Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Element of Space Medicine Division , Human Research Program (HRP) is supporting a ground-based directed research study to evaluate the effects of sleep medications (relative to placebo) on astronaut and other populations analogous to the astronaut population (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors, Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation , and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's) cognitive performance after an abrupt awakening. The second objective of the study is to develop a protocol to select a sleep medication and dose that minimally affects an individual 's cognitive performance upon awakening. Following completion of the study , it is the intent of the BHP Element to work with Space Medicine in the transition of the data and protocol as \"best practices \" for medical operations provided by the Clinical Services Branch in the Space Medicine Division at the NASA Johnson Space Center.\n\nThe study aims to characterize the effects of the most commonly used sleep medications and dosages on performance after an unplanned awakening , while providing the foundation for future development of individualized protocols for sleep medication use during training and on-orbit for astronauts and analogous populations (e.g., Flight Controllers , Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons , medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation , and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's). Findings from the study will also further inform BHP 's development of an education training program related to countermeasures for sleep loss, circadian desynchronization , fatigue, and work overload for astronauts as well as ground crews who work night shifts in support of missions. Results of the study will also inform the human system health and medical standards and requirements for future exploration missions.\n\nThe study protocol was successfully pilot tested in the study titled Develop and Implement Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut Sleep Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (Phase I) with N=7 subjects (6 NASA flight surgeons and 1 BHP Operations professional) as subjects from March through June , 2009. The pilot study results supported the scientific feasibility of conducting a randomized , blinded , placebo controlled study of sleep medication effects on alarm-based awakenings. Preliminary analysis from the pilot study indicated differences in performance upon abrupt awakening between the sleep medication and placebo conditions. Thus, the pilot data also supported the likelihood of new scientific and clinical insights from the Phase II studies with astronauts and the additional analogous populations (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors, Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation, and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's) .\n\nIn the study titled Operational Ground Testing Protocol to Optimize Astronaut Sleep Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (Phase 11), two randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled , cross-over trials will be conducted. The hypnotic medication and the placebo will be indistinguishable by subjects. Experiment 1 will involve N=14 subjects randomized to placebo , 10 mg Zolpidem (Ambien) and 10 mg Zaleplon (Sonata) in counterbalanced order and will be awakened 90 min. post-placebo administration (half at 60 min and half at 90 min). The latter will be done to maintain some degree of blinding relative to the participants knowledge of conditions and the staff working on the protocol. Zolpidem is the most commonly , and Zaleplon is the second most commonly , used sleep aid medication used in spaceflight. Females and those subjects who have had a previous adverse experience with 10 mg zolpidem will be placed into Experiment 2, which will involve N=20 subjects randomized to placebo , 5 mg zolpidem and 10 mg zaleplon. Data acquisition for both experiments will occur in the Astronaut Quarantine Facility (\"AQF\") at JSC. Experimental methods and cognitive outcomes will be the same as those used in the pilot investigation titled Develop and Implement Operational Ground Testing Protocols to Individualize Astronaut Sleep Medication Efficacy and Individual Effects (Phase I). Combined , Experiment 1 and 2 will provide data on zaleplon 10 mg compared to placebo on a total of 34 subjects consisting of astronauts and other subjects considered analogous to the astronaut population (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation, and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's) , which will provide the larger sample needed to identify those subjects who have cognitive performance deficits on abrupt awakening to the less sedating 10 mg zaleplon.\n\nThis is an applied study and it is not feasible to include two or three doses of each drug in order to determine a dose-response curve based on each of the drugs pharmacodynamics. Literature has shown that zaleplon 10 mg will be less disruptive on performance at awakening than zolpidem 10 mg and that zaleplon 20 mg is likely to be comparable in effects to zolpidem 10 mg. However , zaleplon 20 mg is not a commonly used dose in space, whereas zolpidem 10 mg and 5mg, and zaleplon 10 mg are used-hence the study will focus on these drugs and doses. More importantly , the goal of this study is not to determine whether these dose-by-drug comparisons are likely to yield the same average results in astronauts as has been found in the general population (e.g., Roehrs et a., 1994; Wesensten et al., 1996; Greenblatt et al., 1998; Hindmarch et al., 2001). Instead , we began by are focusing on individual astronaut vulnerability to hypnotic sedation on awakening , and having a limited number of astronauts who can realistically participate in the operational research was not realistic or conducive in completing the study. We needed to expand our astronaut population to include international astronauts and other populations deemed analogous to the astronaut population (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation,and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's) . We want to evaluate as many astronauts on these drugs and doses as possible , and in a manner that permits comparisons between both drug type and dose; however , it became necessary to broaden our subject pool in order to reach the desired N. Thus Experiment 1 will evaluate 10 mg zolpidem for males and zaleplon 10 mg relative to placebo in N=14 astronauts and analogous subjects (e.g., Flight Controllers, Flight Directors, Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation,and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's). Experiment 2 will evaluate zolpidem 5 mg and zaleplon 10 mg relative to placebo in N = 20 additional astronauts and other analogous subjects (e.g., Flight Controllers , Flight Directors , Flight Surgeons, medical residents and medical students on NASA rotation,and NASA/contractor employed University of Texas Medical Branch physician's)."

There is also evidence for changes in the blood vessel structure, the metabolism and the responses to vasodilator and constrictor substances that might have long-term health consequences resembling the effects of aging on the cardiovascular system (Hughson and Shoemaker, 2004). Cardiovascular adaptations cause an increased incidence of postflight orthostatic intolerance (fainting), decreased cardiac output and reduced exercise capacity. Besides these postflight effects, weightlessness could also have harmful consequences during the flight. For example, it has been shown that cardiac arrhythmia may occur during space missions, even in healthy individuals (Convertino, 2009).\n\nTo understand the cardiovascular reactions of the human body to changing conditions of gravity is thus an important aim of space science.\n\nWhile non-invasive imaging of microcirculation is a very promising tool to evaluate cardiovascular condition, knowledge on the involvement of the microcirculation in cardiovascular alterations induced by weightlessness is very limited and further research in this field seems promising. Before using a non-invasive technique for imaging the microcirculation during space flights, it has to be evaluated on earth.\n\nDifferent proven simulation models exist for investigating the effects of weightlessness on the human body under terrestrial conditions: head down bed rest, dry and wet immersion, and parabolic flights. Among these models, only parabolic flight recreates a real state of weightlessness (see the participant document of information for a description of parabolic flights). Cardiovascular studies have often been performed during parabolic flights. Within the limitations inherent to the method (short duration of weightlessness - about 21 s - following and followed by hypergravity 20 s periods at 1.8g), some remarkable results have been published over the years.\n\nThe aim of our research approach is to test feasibility of the in vivo evaluation of the microcirculation in parabolic flight in order to be able to better describe cardiovascular response mechanisms under these conditions. In this context, we expect alterations in the microcirculatory flow during the weightlessness period of parabolic flight.\n\nOur approach might help develop a diagnostic tool to more easily identify weightlessness-induced cardiovascular diseases and improve strategies for adapting astronauts to weightlessness prior to the space mission."

                            "Recently, new clinical testing of saccular and utricular function have been developed and validated, the so-called vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials - VEMP (Brantberg et al. 2009, Cornell et al. 2009, Curthoys 2010, Manzari et al. 2012). Among them, the cervical VEMP (cVEMP) are short-latency electromyographic (EMG) modulations of the contracted sternocleidomastoid muscles in responses to vibration applied on the forehead. The clinical literature suggests that cVEMP are almost entirely saccular in origin (Halmagyi et al 1995).\n\nThe aim of our research is to evaluate changes in the otolith function in microgravity and hypergravity using this clinical test. Cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) will be recorded by surface EMG electrodes in response to bone conducted vibration to specifically assess saccular function (Halmagyi et al 1995). The primary measures will include muscle activity response amplitudes and the stimulus intensity threshold at which the cVEMP is detected.\n\nGiven that there is an off-loading of the saccules in microgravity and an increased loading in hypergravity, we hypothesize that there will be a reduction in cVEMP amplitude in microgravity and an increase in cVEMP amplitude in hypregravity compared to normal gravity. These changes in amplitude will be accompanied by changes in the threshold of the stimulus level required to elicit a cVEMP."

                            "Space flights have shown the possibilities and limitations of human adaptation to space. For the last 50 years, results showed that the space environment and microgravity in particular, cause changes that may affect the performance of astronauts. These physiological changes particularly challenge the cardiovascular, metabolic, muscle and bone functions. Space agencies regularly conduct simulations on the ground on healthy volunteers to mimic the effects of weightlessness (head down bed rest model) to better understand the mechanisms of adaptations of the organism to space, and develop ways to prevent and / or reduce the negative biological effects of microgravity on astronauts. These protocols are called countermeasures. Since the beginning of space missions, various countermeasures have been tested on the ground and in-flight, including different exercise protocols. To date, however, none has been entirely satisfactory and space agencies continue to conduct simulation studies to evaluate new countermeasures. Nowadays, the human spaceflight program has entered the next phase of space exploration towards the Moon and Mars and there are clearly inherent medical challenges with such a goal, among which, countermeasure developments are a clear priority.\n\nBased on recent evidences, the next countermeasure to be tested during a 60-day bed rest includes a nutritional countermeasure composed of an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory dietary mix."

Trials vary in terms of what the subject can see and feel during the execution of the task, and on body posture.\n\nA 3D motion caption system is used to track in real-time the movements of the subject' head and hands.

The mean direction (accuracy) along with the trial-to-trial variability (precision) of the GRF vector will be separately determined.

                            "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes of muscle, in microgravity. Which will help explain the health benefits of exercise. There are tests that can be done to tell researchers more about the human body, such as a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, which measures body composition (fat and lean body mass). The use of muscle testing and a Handgrip test can tell us about the strength and power within an individual's muscles. A VO2 max test helps us understand the aerobic fitness level of an individual and one of the most important aspects of this study are muscle cells. A muscle biopsy allows us to obtain muscle cells from the thigh, which will be sent into space by a rocket. Researchers will study these muscle cells in a low gravity environment aboard the International Space Station. Studying the muscle cells under those conditions will potentially mimic an accelerated aging process, which will help researchers better understand muscle wasting in the elderly."

Heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will be recorded throughout this test. Subjects will breathe through a low resistance mouthpiece and wear a nose clip. Expired gases will be measured by indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitored by a portable heart rate monitor. Following a standardized warm up, subjects will begin exercising at a moderate intensity with the workload increased every minute until the subject can no longer continue. A leveling-off (plateau) or decline in oxygen uptake should be demonstrated in order to be reasonably sure that a subject has achieved the maximum capacity for aerobic metabolism."

Cell membrane, cytoskeleton, cytoplasm and nucleus have been found to be sensible to gravitational changes. Alterations in the male and female reproductive systems have also been reported in mouse and other animals. The effects of microgravity on human reproductive cells remain unknown.\n\nThe main objective of this experimental study is to investigate the effect of simulated microgravity in human male reproductive cells under in vitro conditions. Induced microgravity conditions will be obtained with a smaller single-engine aerobatic aircraft that can provide parabolic flights.\n\nThe main parameters to be analyzed are: sperm motility, vitality, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis."

This kit is based on a controlled DNA denaturation process to facilitate the subsequent removal of the proteins contained in each spermatozoon. In this way, normal spermatozoa create halos formed by loops of DNA at the head of the sperm, which are not present in those with damaged DNA.\n\nThresholds for frequency of Sperm DNA Fragmentation (SDF) have been suggested by Dr. Evenson et al.

                            "Annexin V recognizes an antigen (externalized phosphatidylserine, EPS) in the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cell depletion begins with the magnetic labeling of apoptotic cells by the MACS\u00ae ART Annexin V Reagent. The labeled cells are then passed through a separation column located in a fixed magnetic field. Unwanted cells are selectively retained in the column. Living spermatozoa are not labeled by the reagent, so they pass through the column and are collected for later use.\n\nIn our study, after collecting living spermatozoa we also collected the retained apoptotic spermatozoa for comparing the concentration (M/ml) of apoptotic vs no apoptotic cells."

                            "Many individuals with tinnitus have abnormal oscillatory brain activity in their temporal areas (Weisz et al. (2005), Schlee et al. (2014)). Led by this finding, attempts to normalize such localized pathological activity by neuro-feedback techniques have been tested (Dohrmann et al. (2007), G\u00fctenspenger et al. (2017)). These attempts highlighted interindividual variability that can be explained by lack of selection of the patient population and lack of guidance through the therapy. The present study is aimed at addressing these issues by choosing more selectively a patient subpopulation (tinnitus associated with moderate hearing loss) and by implementing a guidance interface during the treatment.\n\nThe therapy will consist of 10 neuro-feedback training sessions of 29 minutes over 5 weeks. Each session will be composed of 6 blocks of 3 min in which the patient will be incited to practise a specific cognitive strategy (mental exercise such as \"think to a music you like\") and resting state measurements.\n\nEach patient who has been recruited to fit our inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will first go through a clinical assessment of his initial judgment criteria metrics. Then subjects will go through the 5-week training and then will be evaluated on the same criteria just after the end of the therapy and at 3 months after the end of it."

                            "Space flights have shown the possibilities and limitations of human adaptation to space. For the last 50 years, results showed that the space environment and microgravity in particular, cause changes that may affect the performance of astronauts. These physiological changes are now better known: prolonged exposure to a weightlessness environment can lead to significant loss of bone, muscle mass, strength, cardiovascular and sensory-motor deconditioning, immune, hormonal and metabolism changes. Nevertheless, more recent missions have revealed a new suite of physiological adaptations and consequences of space flight. Indeed, astronauts exposed to prolonged weightlessness experience hyperopic shifts and structural alteration in the eye (e.g., choroidal folds and optic disc edema). This condition was defined by NASA as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). Some of these vision changes remain unresolved for years after flight. This phenomenon has most likely existed since the beginning of human space flight, but is just recently being recognized as a major consequence of adaptation to microgravity. Changes in vision and eye structure are thought to be the result of prolonged exposure to space flight-induced headward fluid shifts and elevated intracranial pressure. Loss of the hydrostatic pressure gradient during spaceflight leads to this redistribution of body fluids toward the head. To prepare for future manned missions beyond the low Earth Orbit, the mechanisms underlying SANS syndrome have to be investigated and countermeasures designed to reverse or prevent SANS are required. Venoconstrictive thigh cuffs (VTCs) represent one possible countermeasure to mitigate a headward fluid shift. The Russian Space Agency uses VTCs (bracelets) to sequester fluid in the lower limbs and mitigate the subjective sensation of head congestion during space-flight. Moreover, experiments on 6-month Mir missions demonstrated that bracelets reduced jugular vein cross-sectional area in cosmonauts by 12% to 20%. However, it is unknown how VTCs (including bracelets) affect ocular physiologic features. The space agencies are actively engaged in studying the initiation and progression of SANS syndrome through studies on the International Space Station and on the ground. Indeed, considering the limited number of flight opportunities, the difficulties related to the performance of in-flight experiments (operational constraints for astronauts, limited capabilities of in-flight biomedical devices), ground-based experiments simulating the effects of weightlessness are used to better understand the mechanisms of physiological adaptation, design and validate the countermeasures. Different methods are used to simulate microgravity on Earth. However, two separate approaches, -6\u00b0 head-down bed rest (HDBR) and dry immersion (DI) have provided possibilities for long-term exposures with findings closest to those seen with a weightless state. They produce changes in body composition (including body fluid redistribution), cardiovascular and skeletal muscle characteristics that resemble the effects of microgravity. The common physiological denominator is the combination of a cephalad shift of body fluids and reduced physical activity. Unlike bed rest, dry immersion provides a unique opportunity to study the physiological effects of the lack of a supporting structure for the body. Dry immersion means immersing into the thermoneutral water covered with special elastic free floating waterproof fabric. The subject, surrounded by film and \"free suspended\" in the water mass, remains dry. During horizontal immersion, pressure forces are distributed nearly equally around the entire surface of the body (only the head and neck are not entirely supported by water). The absence of mechanical support of specific zones during immersion creates a state akin to weightlessness that is called \"supportlessness\". Physiological changes under DI develop more rapidly and are more profound than under HDBR. This advanced ground-based model is extremely suited to test countermeasures for microgravity-induced deconditioning and physical inactivity-related pathologies.\n\nThe present study is organized in this context by the French space agency (CNES) to assess on twenty healthy male volunteers the effects of thigh cuffs to prevent the deconditioning induced by 5 days of dry immersion and in particular the fluid shift and its related ophthalmological disorders. Using an integrated approach, the CNES has selected ten scientific protocols to assess the changes in the different physiological fields and the potential beneficial effects of the countermeasure to prevent and/or reduce these changes."

We will also compute three ratios, torso length/hip width, arm length/shoulder width and leg length/hip width. All measures sill be entered into a program that draws the body shape.The computer program will then produce 13 body shapes that differ from 40% to 160% of the width of the original one, in 10% steps. A selection of 9 shapes out of the 13 is presented to the participant, ranked from the thinnest to the widest.

                            "Spaceflight induces detrimental changes in most organ systems with both acute changes and chronic adaptations. For example, acute fluid shifts associated with weightlessness (also called - improperly - microgravity) cause initial rapid cardiovascular alterations, whereas the chronic changes are more reflective of cardiovascular deconditioning and cerebrovascular/ocular adaptations (Pavy-Le Traon et al., 2007).\n\nLong-duration stays in weightlessness have resulted in ocular structural and functional adaptations in some astronauts, which has been termed the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS ; see review in Lee et al., 2018). The leading hypothesis is that ocular changes are the consequence of chronic exposure to the weightlessness-induced headward (cephalad) fluid shift experienced by all astronauts. Countermeasures targeted to reverse this fluid shift, including lower body negative pressure and veno-occlusive thigh cuffs, have been proposed and tested in ground-based studies using a head-down tilt model of the cephalad fluid shift. However, the amount of fluid shift reversal required to prevent the development of SANS has not been investigated or determined. Similarly, artificial gravity through centrifugation has been proposed as a SANS countermeasure, given its ability to reverse headward fluid shifts and its efficacy as a countermeasure to long-duration bed rest-induced cardiovascular adaptations (long-duration bed rest is widely employed to simulate the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems). However, the minimum level of artificial gravity required also has not been investigated.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to characterize cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and ocular changes across a range of gravity levels to identify a threshold of gravitational load that can serve as a countermeasure to SANS during future spaceflight missions."

                            "When astronauts return from space flight, they manifest a set of symptoms, the most striking of which is orthostatic intolerance, that is, the inability to stay upright. This orthostatic intolerance is related to cardiovascular adaptation and disappears in a few days, but the prospect of long-term space travel makes this maladaptation a major concern of space agencies, at a time when there is serious consideration to make \" land \"a ship on Mars.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that brain vessel adaptation may contribute to spatial post-flight orthostatic intolerance. The question remains controversial because not all studies are consistent. These studies are all based on the measurement of blood flow in a single artery of the brain (the average cerebral, see cerebral circulation diagram) easily accessible with a Doppler ultrasound machine. Our team has good reason to believe that the adaptation of the cerebral vessels is not carried out in the same way in all the arteries of the brain and that in particular the arteries that irrigate the posterior and inferior parts of the brain are a major determinant. from cerebrovascular adaptation to orthostatism and that orthostatic intolerance is more specifically related to a decrease in blood flow in these arteries. On the other hand our team has shown that the external carotid artery plays, under certain conditions, a buffer role of the sudden variations of perfusion pressure of the brain.\n\nDuring the weightless phase of parabolic flight, part of the blood from the legs and abdomen \"rises\" to the thorax and this transfer of fluid induces changes in blood pressure and cardiac output that affect the cerebral circulation. From a cardiovascular point of view, it is the same thing for a seated subject to lie down, but the parabolic flight offers the unique possibility of achieving this transfer in a fraction of a second and thus allowing to study the immediate response of the cerebral circulation. .\n\nInvestigators goal is therefore to quantify the changes in blood flow in the posterior and anterior territories of the brain (transcranial ultrasound) as well as in the internal carotid and vertebral (Doppler ultrasound) during changes in blood pressure and cardiac output induced by transfers. liquid resources associated with the transition to weightlessness.\n\nThe oxidative stress generated by weightlessness has been identified as a determining factor in cerebrovascular deconditioning associated with orthostatic intolerance. In order to quantify the biochemical markers of this stress, a venous sample will be taken before and just after the parabolic flight."

                            "Parabolic flights make it possible to produce a reduced gravity environment on Earth. With the specially adapted A310 Zero-G, each parable produces a period of zero gravity (\"0g\"). The duration of the periods of reduced gravity is about 21 seconds. Each parable begins and ends with a resource (hyper-gravity) at 1.8 g; each resource lasts about 20 seconds. A typical flight lasts from two to three hours and includes 30 parabolic maneuvers, usually all in weightlessness.\n\nParticipants will arrive at Novespace, at Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport, no later than 2 pm the day before the first flight of the campaign in order to participate in the security briefing. A delay of at least 2 hours will be granted before collection of their written consent.\n\nBefore the flight, the participants will necessarily participate in the safety briefing (2h, organized by the Flight Manager (Novespace) and will meet the research team to become familiar with the procedures and devices that will be used during the experiment.\n\nOn the day of the flight, the participants will have to arrive at the premises of Novespace before 7.30am.\n\nBefore the flight, they will be prepared for flight recordings. Seven self-adhesive electrodes will be placed on the chest to measure the electrical activity of the heart and the blood volume in the chest.\n\nA venous blood test to measure blood markers of oxidative stress will be performed by a doctor or a registered nurse.\n\nDoppler and ultrasound operators will make blood flow measurements in the vertebral, internal carotid, posterior cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries) using an echo-doppler device. These measures are strictly non-invasive and painless. Participants can take medication against motion sickness under the supervision of the flight doctor. The duration of the study is a little less than 6 hours (2 hours before the flight, 3 hours flight, 30 minutes after the flight).\n\nPreparation before parables, in the plane. In addition to the participant, two other subjects will be the participants of the flight, one will also be a subject, and the third will be a rescue participant who will be tested in case the subject or his partner falls ill during the flight. The flight includes 31 parables, but the first participant will be subject only for 16 parables and the second for 15.\n\nWhen it is not subject, the participant is rid of equipment and can join the so-called \"free floating\" area to enjoy the sensations of weightlessness.\n\nAfter takeoff, but before the first parable the subject (or the other participant) will sit on a chair built for the flight. His pelvis will be immobilized by restraints to prevent him from floating freely during the weightlessness.\n\nIt will be connected to different measuring equipment, all non-invasive:\n\nAn arterial pressure sensor on the finger. Electrotrocardiogram (connected to 3 self-adhesive electrodes) Thoracic impedance meter (connected to 4 self-adhesive electrodes) An oxygen scope (for measuring the expired CO2).\n\nDuring the flight During each phase of weightlessness, an operator will apply on the neck or skull of the subject an ultrasound measurement probe (as on the ground). We recommend that participants do not move their head, especially during periods of hypergravity, to prevent motion sickness.\n\nExcept in exceptional circumstances, the aircraft normally completes the mission, but it must be clear that the subject is free to withdraw his consent and participation in the experiment at any time, without prejudice to him or to any other reason, without justification, including during the flight.\n\nAfter the flight Following the flight, a second venous sample will be made to determine the effects of weightlessness on the markers of oxidative stress."

                            "The proposal contained herein seeks to examine the effect of simulated microgravity on important cell-cell interactions that govern vascular health. The interest lies in endothelial cell (EC) and macrophage cell interactions. The investigators are proposing to first understand how microgravity effects the macrophage and EC function or pro-healing capabilities. Next, the study team plans to develop a 3D tissue regeneration model in which macrophages and ECs are co-cultured in a hydrogel matrix. Utilizing this model, the team will assess how microgravity influenced macrophage-EC interactions in 3D. The investigators will assess EC tubule volume (or blood vessel development), macrophage spreading and the interactions with endothelial tubule sprouts. This model will serve as a critical foundation for future grant opportunities as it allows the assessment of tissue regeneration and vascular health in a 3D tissue microenvironment"

                            "While some knowledge has been gained with regards to macrophage alterations during space travel, most of this work has been limited to macrophage cell lines and has not considered how the effects of microgravity alter macrophages' ability to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration. Specifically, how the macrophage secretion profile and/or interaction with endothelial cells is altered during microgravity culture. Given the extensive data showing the consequence of simulated microgravity to alter endothelial cells, and the mounting evidence that simulated microgravity affects macrophage cells, the investigators hypothesize that microgravity alters the functional response of macrophages in close association with endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, the study team has established 2 specific aims:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Assess the effect of simulated microgravity on endothelial and macrophage pro-healing states.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Assess the effect of simulated microgravity on the pro-healing states of 3-dimensional co-cultured macrophages and endothelial cells.\n\nCompletion of the above described aims will lay a strong foundation of knowledge about the impact of simulated microgravity in important cell-cell interactions involved in tissue regeneration and healing"

                            "The risk of a severe medical event during long-duration spaceflight is significant and can endanger both the whole mission and crew. There is a certain risk for a cardiac arrest in space requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). So far, 5 known techniques to perform CPR in microgravity have been reported.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to describe and gather data for two new CPR techniques useful in microgravity.\n\nThe investigators conducted a randomized controlled manikin trial and asked 15 participants with valid diving-license to resuscitate a manikin in two different techniques of CPR in a free-floating position underwater. The first technique, (Schmitz-Hinkelbein-Method) is similar to conventional CPR, with the patient in a supine position on the performer's knees for stabilization. The second technique (Hinkelbein-Schmitz-Method) is similar to the first, but chest compressions are conducted with the elbow."

                            "Kinocardiographic measures mechanical and electrical function of the heart. The proposed solution is based on measurements of body vibrations. By measuring these movements on the surface of the body, it is possible to deduce, taking into account the individual's weight and size, the quality of the heartbeat that caused this vibration. The technique developed consists of a device measuring these vibrations at two places in the body: on the torso (Seismocardiography) and on the lower back (Ballistocardiography). The first measurement is a reflection of the local strength of the heartbeat as well as the transmission of blood to the body's main artery, the aorta. The second measurement, in the lower back, is the result of the contraction and movement of blood within the arterial system. Based on these two measurements, the energy produced by the heart and transmitted to the torso or the whole body is calculated. The energy over an entire cardiac cycle and the distribution of that energy within a heartbeat are used to characterize the mechanical function of the heart.\n\nClinical studies carried out previously have demonstrated the repeatability of kinocardiographic measurements (KCG) and their robustness with respect to the use of different sensors.\n\nKCG measurements also showed a high sensitivity (> 94%) to different hemodynamic states induced by the injection of active inotropic agents, i.e. dobutamine also used as a treatment for heart failure in an advanced stage. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study controlled by Placebo, these measurements showed a strong correlation (r = 0.8, p <0.0001) with cardiac output measured by echocardiography. The technique has also demonstrated its ability to track changes in cardiac mechanical function during expiratory voluntary apnea.\n\nKCG measurements were also evaluated during a micro-gravity simulation in Bedrest on 23 healthy volunteers. The measurements tracked cardiac deconditioning in the control group compared to the exercise group similarly to cardiac MRI measurements. Subsequently, KCG metrics showed an ability to distinguish reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) heart failure patients from non-insufficient patients. These latest results also showed that the chest sensor alone was sufficient to separate HFrEF patients from normative patients, laying the foundation for possible use of the smartphone alone.\n\nThe prototype of a mobile application, named OKCARDIO, makes it possible to take measurements perfectly similar to the Kino thoracic sensor, but to date have never been used it in a clinical study. Such a tool would allow anyone with a smartphone-type mobile phone to measure their cardiac mechanical function themselves and make it available to the attending physician."

The project targets NASA's particular interest in studying the 'Cognitive-perceptual-visuospatial brain domain changes due to isolation and confinement' as part of the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research (CIPHER) project on the International Space Station (ISS). The collected data will demonstrate whether prolonging mission duration to one year will have detrimental effects on general cognitive performance (measured with the Cognition test battery), spatial cognition, structural and functional brain changes in general, and hippocampal plasticity more specifically relative to the shorter 6-month and 2-month ISS missions. Using state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, investigators will determine the biological basis for any changes in cognitive performance, with a focus on hippocampal plasticity and spatial cognition. Similar data already gathered on the ISS and in several short- and long-duration space analog environments will be used to generate a normative data base for long-duration missions. Finally, investigators will derive dose-response relationships between cognitive-visuospatial brain domain changes and mission duration that will allow predicting vulnerability to adverse cognitive or behavioral impairment and psychiatric disorders on interplanetary expeditions such as a mission to Mars. The two projects will deliver a highly unique and comprehensive set of integrated neuroimaging and neurocognitive tools for the evaluation and ultimately prevention of adverse effects on brain structure and function that lead to behavioral effects associated with exploration-type missions."

                            "Physical activity appears to be an important lifestyle habit to achieve healthy aging by promoting autonomy and quality of life. Interestingly, the dramatic changes that the human body undergoes due to bedrest for illnesses and hospitalization are similar to those seen over decades of normal aging. Bedrest in otherwise healthy older individuals can lead to a reduction of muscle size and strength, changes in bone strength and function of the heart and blood vessels. Bedrest can also lead to changes in keeping proper balance as well as changes in processing and understanding information. All of these factors negatively affect activities of daily living leading to physical function impairment and development of frailty, a clinical condition associated with an increased risk for disease and death.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether exercise can counteract the negative effects of 2-week head tilt down bed rest on muscle function and metabolism, postural control, bone structure, orthostatic tolerance and cognitive function in adults.\n\nFor this study the investigators will recruit 24 healthy men and women between 55 - 65 years of age. All subjects will spend a total of 26 days (5 days of adaption period, 14 days of bed rest with 6 degrees of downward inclination, and 7 days of recovery period) at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC). During this study, 12 subjects will randomly undergo an exercise intervention as countermeasure during the 14 days of bed rest period and 12 will serve as control.\n\nEach subjects participation in this study will involve 1 telephone call (pre-screening) and 4 visits at the MUHC: 1 screening visit (Visit 1) followed by a 26-day long visit (Visit 2) and 2 follow-up visits (Visit 3 and Visit 4). During Visits 2 - 4 various measurements will be performed to assess sensorimotor control, muscle function and metabolism, bone structure, cardiovascular function, cognitive performance and function, and specimen collection (blood, urine, saliva, feces and muscle tissue)."

This project will provide data about the efficacy of lower body negative pressure to mimic daily upright posture by intermittently lowering central venous pressure while in simulated microgravity (3 days of bed rest). The investigators expect that 3 days of bed rest will increase choroid thickness, and choroid area. The investigators hypothesize that nightly LBNP (-20mmHg) will prevent these changes."

                            "The visual impairment observed in many astronauts after long duration spaceflight aboard the International Space Station is considered the most important mission-threatening medical problem identified in the last decade of the space program. Between 2012 and 2014, NASA and NSBRI have spent $3-4 million/year investigating the clinical course and underlying mechanisms of this condition, termed the Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure Syndrome (VIIP) because of its theoretical association with elevated intracranial pressure and central venous pressure. During the previous funding cycle, the investigators for this application performed the first invasive measures of intracranial pressure during acute (head down tilt bedrest and parabolic flight) and chronic (24 hours HDT bedrest) changes in gravitational gradients simulating spaceflight in healthy humans. Novel observations made from those studies determined that 1) there is a large range of central venous pressure experienced normally during changes in posture in daily life; 2) these changes occur within seconds of postural transients from upright to supine and then are stable over time in that position; 3) with acute assumption of simulated microgravity (HDT bedrest), intracranial pressure and central venous pressure goes up slightly from the supine position, but over the next 24 hours, returns toward, and sometimes below the supine value because of spatial compensation within the brain; 4) during true microgravity (parabolic flight), the acute reduction in central venous pressure reduces cerebral outflow resistance and ICP decreases compared to the supine position, though remains above the upright position in 1G.\n\nThe current hypothesis is that the VIIP syndrome is Not due to a pathologically elevated central venous or intracranial pressure. However, because there is not the usual reduction in pressure typically seen in the upright position on earth, the incessant, low level elevation in ICP (i.e., greater than upright, but less than supine) leads to adaptive changes in the eye which ultimately result in globe flattening, choroidal folds, and visual impairment. Preliminary data suggest that the use of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) can lower ICP while in the head down position, towards the values observed upright. The investigators propose that applying LBNP during sleep in space would be a practical strategy to restore a relevant (though reversed) circadian variability in central venous pressure that would then prevent adaptive changes in the eye. The investigators propose the following hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 1: Repeated administration of LBNP at night will cause a safe, sustained reduction in central venous pressure while asleep. This restoration of effective circadian variability in central venous pressure will prevent structural changes in the eye induced by microgravity. To test this hypothesis, the long-term efficacy of nightly LBNP (6-8 hrs) to simulate the upright position and prevent structural changes in the eye during four days of bedrest. Comprehensive, non-invasive state-of-the-art imaging will be used to examine the structure of the visual apparatus, using optical coherence tomography combined with invasive direct measurement of CVP."

                            "Dry immersion (DI) is a ground-based model of prolonged conditions of simulated microgravity. Dry immersion involves immersing the subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric. As a result, the immersed subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains dry. Within a relatively short duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most physiological effects of actual microgravity, including centralization of body fluids, support unloading, and hypokinesia.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the physiological changes induced by 5 days of dry immersion in the female organism. The main physiological systems will be explored before, during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific tests and measurements. The results will be analyzed by scientists specializing in each field in order to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare its effects with those of the bedrest model and those of spaceflight. The clinical (adverse effects, comfort of subjects) and operational aspects are also part of the secondary objectives of the study."

                            "The space agencies are actively engaged in studying the physiological adaptation to space environment through studies on board the International Space Station (ISS) but also on the ground. Ground-based experiments simulating the effects of weightlessness are used to better understand the mechanisms of physiological adaptation, design and validate the countermeasures. Dry immersion (DI) is a ground-based model of prolonged conditions of simulated microgravity, which has been mainly used in Russia. The past years however, the model has been implemented as well in Europe and expertise in conducting DI studies has been gained in particular in France where a few DI studies have been conducted in the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse for CNES (French Space Agency). Dry immersion involves immersing the subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric. As a result, the immersed subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains dry. Within a relatively short duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most physiological effects of actual microgravity, including centralization of body fluids, support unloading, and hypokinesia. Furthermore, physiological changes have been reported in the neuromuscular, skeletal and sensorimotor systems, in fluid electrolyte regulation, in the cardiovascular system, metabolism, blood and immunity, respiration, and thermoregulation. Dry immersion provides a unique opportunity to study the physiological effects of the lack of a supporting structure for the body (a phenomenon called 'supportlessness'). As such, dry immersion is proposed to mimic actual spaceflight in terms of the monotonous environment, posture-motion limitations, hemodynamic changes and hypokinetic effects, support unloading, and decreased proprioceptive input. Immersion studies have so far only been conducted in men and a minority of studies using the bedrest model have included women. Likewise, few studies conducted to date have investigated gender differences in the astronaut population. The small number of female astronauts may be part of the reason why scientific data are lacking to draw valid conclusions about possible gender differences. However, if women currently constitute only about 10% of astronauts, women are and will be more and more represented in crews. Women now constitute 30% of American crews and NASA (US space agency) has announced gender parity for crews on future lunar missions. It is therefore essential to study the physiological changes induced by weightlessness in women, to compare them with those observed in men and to develop efficient countermeasures for preventing them. The main physiological systems will be explored before, during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific standardized tests and measurements. The objective of the study is to evaluate the physiological changes induced by 5 days of dry immersion in the female organism. The study conditions such as patient recruitment, nutrition, data collection, data management, reporting for adverse events are standardized. The results will be analyzed by scientists specializing in each field in order to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare its effects with those of the bedrest model and those of spaceflight. The clinical (adverse effects, comfort of subjects) and operational aspects are also part of the secondary objectives of the study.\n\nTwenty healthy female subjects will participate in the study. There is no published data on dry immersion with female participation to help calculation the sample size. Moreover, female spaceflight and bedrest data are scarce, and do not provide any insight into inter-individual variability. This prolonged DI protocol in women is conceived as a pilot, descriptive, explorative study, as well as an operational and methodological study. Power-based calculation of the number of subjects is not directly applicable for such explorative studies. However, based on effect sizes obtained with previous DI studies in men, a total of 20 subjects was deemed necessary for this study."

Participants will be healthy, high functioning adults (e.g., medical residents, postdoctoral fellows in the sciences, math, and engineering) who report elevated psychological distress, mood or anxiety symptoms. Participants will complete a self-guided online therapy program (MyCompass) and will be randomized to receive one of the following: (1) online therapy without therapist support, 2) online therapy plus therapist support via electronic text-based messaging (i.e., secure email), or 3) online therapy plus therapist support via video messaging. Outcomes will be evaluated weekly via online self-report measures of psychological distress, mood, anxiety, number of hours and quality of sleep, fatigue, and resiliency indicators (i.e., coping and mindfulness). The investigators will examine changes over time in outcomes across all three groups. The investigators hypothesize that the two enhanced treatment conditions (i.e., those with therapist support) will outperform the online self-management program without support.

                            "In this project, the investigators propose to test effectiveness of a daily nutraceutical supplement containing bioactive B vitamins to mitigate optic disc edema in astronauts. The proposed countermeasure is intended to maximize functioning of the one-carbon metabolic pathway to provide enough substrate and cofactors to overcome any genetic differences that may impact the efficiency of enzyme function. By optimizing the pathway, this will 1) optimize endothelial function by increasing eNOS coupling and nitric oxide synthesis and 2) optimize collagen firmness and elasticity in the sclera and lamina cribrosa, and 3) minimize changes in total retinal thickness during and after flight.\n\nThe protocol includes assessments of ocular health and function, along with determinants of vascular endothelial function, advanced glycation end products, and nutritional status and one carbon biochemistry. These additional measures will be critical for the further definition of the causes of optic disc edema in some astronauts after long-duration space flight, and in understanding the effect of the countermeasure. Finally, the supplemented subjects in this study will be compared against total retinal thickness data from previously flown astronauts known to have not taken supplements during their missions."

                            "Fasting (8-h) blood samples (7.5 mL SST and 5 mL EDTA tubes, 12.5 mL total per session) will be collected approximately 180 days and 45 days before flight, on approximate flight day 90, and 30 days before landing, Return to Earth +0-2 days and 30 days after landing.\n\nBlood samples will be analyzed for vitamin status and one-carbon biochemistry, as previously described. One blood sample (collected before flight) will be analyzed for approximately 511 SNPs matching the profile of testing from our ongoing research related to optic disc edema. Serum samples will be analyzed for biochemistry measures evaluating endothelial function, vitamin status, and oxidative damage.\n\nNutritional status assessment data, including inflight dietary intake and body mass data, completed for routine medical requirements will be requested for data sharing. Inflight medical exercise log data as well as available standard measures data will also be requested for data sharing. Medication use/Med Logs will also be requested for data sharing.\n\nVascular function VENDYS-II (Endothelix, Inc) will be used to assess reactive hyperaemia through changes in fingertip temperature. The test consists of an automated blood pressure measurement followed by cuff occlusion of the right arm for 2 to 5 min. During this time, the fingertip temperature in the right hand decreases because of the lack of circulation in the fingertip. After the cuff is released, blood flow resumes, causing a temperature rebound in the fingertip in a manner that is proportional to vascular reactivity.\n\nAdvanced Glycation End (AGE) Products Skin autofluorescence (SAF) will be analyzed non-invasively using an AGE reader (Diagnoptics Technologies, Groningen, the Netherlands). The AGE reader illuminates a skin surface of approximately 4 cm2, guarded against surrounding light, with an excitation light source with wavelength between 300 and 429 nm. This method is based on the fluorescent properties of certain AGEs accumulated in dermal tissue.\n\nOCT and OCT-A Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A) scans will be acquired using the Spectralis OCT2 (Heidelberg Engineering) before, during, and after flight. The scan pattern includes 24 B-scans centered in a radial pattern over the optic nerve head, as well as a 3.5 mm circle scan surrounding the optic nerve head for assessment of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and choroid thickness. For OCT-A, five consecutive volume scans will be obtained in these regions, each containing 216 A-scans. These images will be registered, and the consecutive B-scans will be used to calculate the decorrelation among the images to provide split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA) images. This decorrelation between consecutive B-scan images will be used to highlight locations where there is blood flow. The density of the perfused peripapillary vessels within the various layers of the retina will be calculated to create a flow density map."

                            "Dry immersion (DI) is a ground-based model of prolonged conditions of simulated microgravity. Dry immersion involves immersing the subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric. As a result, the immersed subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains dry. Within a relatively short duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most physiological effects of actual microgravity, including centralization of body fluids, support unloading, and hypokinesia.\n\nThe main objective of the present study is to investigate the physiological effects of 5 days of dry immersion in 20 healthy male subjects, and to obtain DI-in-Men Reference Dataset. A set of measurements will assess the changes in the cardiovascular, neuro-ophthalmological, hematological, metabolic, sensorimotor, immune, muscle and bone systems."

                            "Space flights have shown the possibilities and limitations of human adaptation to space. For the last 50 years, results have shown that the space environment and microgravity in particular, cause changes that may affect the performance of astronauts. These physiological changes are now better known: prolonged exposure to weightlessness can lead to significant loss of bone and muscle mass, strength, cardiovascular and sensory-motor deconditioning, immune, hormonal and metabolic changes .\n\nMoreover, recently a new suite of physiological adaptations and consequences of space flight has been acknowledged. Indeed, after long flights, some astronauts present persistent ophthalmologic changes, mostly a hyperopic shift, an increase in optic nerve sheath diameter and occasionally a papillary oedema now defined by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). Some of these vision changes remain unresolved for years post-flight. This phenomenon has most likely existed since the beginning of human space flight but is just recently being recognized as a major consequence of adaptation to microgravity.\n\nOverall, spaceflight induces physiological multi-system deconditioning which may impact astronauts' efficiency and create difficulties upon their return to normal gravity. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these processes and developing efficient countermeasures to prevent, limit or reverse this deconditioning remain important challenges and major priorities for manned space programs.\n\nThe space agencies are actively engaged in studying the physiological adaptation to space environment through studies on board the International Space Station (ISS) but also on the ground. Indeed, considering the limited number of flight opportunities, the difficulties related to the performance of in-flight experiments (operational constraints for astronauts, limited capabilities of in-flight biomedical devices), ground-based experiments simulating the effects of weightlessness are used to better understand the mechanisms of physiological adaptation, design and validate the countermeasures. Different methods are used to simulate microgravity on Earth. However, two approaches, -6\u00b0 head-down bed rest (HDBR) and dry immersion (DI) have provided possibilities for long-term exposures with findings closest to those seen with a weightless state. They produce changes in body composition (including body fluid redistribution), cardiovascular and skeletal muscle characteristics that resemble the effects of microgravity.\n\nThe common physiological denominator is the combination of a cephalad shift of body fluids and reduced physical activity. Being similar in their effects on the human body, these models, however, differ in their specifics and acting factors. The HDBR, as the name implies, implicates a long (from several weeks to a year) stay in the supine position, the head tilted down by -6\u00b0 from the horizontal plane. HDBR is the most frequently used ground-based simulation for gravitational unloading of the human body in western countries.\n\nUnlike bed rest, dry immersion provides a unique opportunity to study the physiological effects of the lack of a supporting structure for the body. Dry immersion means immersing the subject into thermoneutral water, while covered with a special elastic free floating waterproof fabric. The subject, surrounded by the tarp and \"freely suspended\" in the water mass, remains dry. During horizontal immersion, pressure forces are distributed nearly equally around the entire surface of the body (only the head and neck are not entirely supported by water). The absence of mechanical support of specific anatomic zones during immersion creates a state akin to weightlessness called \"supportlessness\". Physiological changes under DI develop more rapidly and are more profound than under HDBR . This advanced ground-based model is extremely suited to test countermeasures for microgravity-induced deconditioning and physical inactivity-related pathologies.\n\nIn 2015, DI facility has been installed at the Space Clinic in Toulouse (France), and a first in Europe three-day dry immersion study was carried out in 12 healthy male volunteers. That study demonstrated an important headward fluid transfer with a significant dilatation of the jugular veins, an increase in venous blood velocities and intracranial pressure, as well as ophthalmological changes consistent with a presumable increase in intracranial pressure at the head at over 20 mmHg (normal values 7 to 15 mmHg), which confirms that dry immersion is a good model to simulate the effects of fluid transfer. In 2019, a second dry-immersion experiment, this time lasting 5 days, was conducted in 18 healthy male volunteers. The goal was to quantify the effect of venoconstrictive thigh cuffs, used for 10 hours/day as a countermeasure, on the time course and extent of DI-induced alterations in body fluids, cephalic circulation, fundus, and brain. These two studies have sparked the interest in the dry immersion model.\n\nIndeed, the European Space Agency (ESA) has decided to include this model in the research programs it promotes on the effects of weightlessness. As a first step, ESA decided to carry out a standardization work like the one done on the bedrest model. ESA tasked a group of European experts to design a first study and the tests that would need to be carried out to better understand and validate the model.\n\nFew studies conducted to date have investigated gender differences in the astronaut population.\n\nThe small number of female astronauts may be part of the reason why scientific data are lacking to draw valid conclusions about possible gender differences. However, if women currently constitute only about 12% of astronauts (only 72 women out of 596 astronauts as of December 2021), they are and will be more and more represented in crews. They now constitute 30% of American crews and NASA (US space agency) has announced gender parity for crews on future lunar missions. It is therefore essential to study the physiological changes induced by weightlessness in both sexes, and to develop efficient sex-specific countermeasures. The expert group has therefore concluded that two different studies with the same design should be carried out, one in women and one in men, to obtain a comparable dataset. An immersion period of 5 days was determined to induce the physiological changes they wish to study. A battery of tests has thus been defined by this expert group based on standard tests carried out in bedrest studies (Bedrest Standard Measurements), supplemented by additional tests to further investigate the model and to acquire a better understanding of the time course of the physiological changes in both sexes.\n\nThis work has started in 2021 with a first study, conducted in women during a 5-day immersion period (awaiting publication). The next step is to realize a similar set of measurements in men, to standardize the dry immersion model taking into account sex differences.\n\nThis study falls within this context and will be the first ESA dry immersion study carried out in men. Its objective is to obtain a standardized dataset for DI in men, which will serve as a basis for the development and evaluation of countermeasures to support future space missions. The main physiological systems will be explored before, during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific tests and measurements. The results will be analyzed by scientists specializing in each field in order to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare its effects with those of the bedrest model and those of spaceflight. Comparison with results obtained in the female population will be a major part of the analysis. The clinical (adverse effects, comfort of subjects) and operational aspects are also part of the secondary objectives of the study."

                            "Anemia is a lack of red blood cells (RBCs) in the circulation. Because RBCs carry the oxygen your body needs to function, anemia can affect one's ability to stay awake, alert, and perform physical activities. Anemia may happen for several reasons, including increased RBC destruction. Anemia often occurs in people who have been in bed for long periods (e.g., if they are very sick) or have decreased mobility (anemia of immobility). Interestingly, astronauts who have left Earth and traveled in space also return anemic. In fact, 5 decades of NASA data showed that astronauts' anemia was more severe the longer they were in space. In another study, astronauts aboard the International Space Station were shown to destroy 54% more of their RBCs in space. RBC destruction may be the culprit of space anemia as well as anemia of immobility on Earth. The ANEMIA Study proposes to measure key aspects of RBC destruction in astronauts in space. These measures will test critical hypotheses on the effects of spaceflight on red blood cells."

                            "On the eve of the next long voyages into space and the event of space tourism, it becomes more and more urgent to understand how to preserve the health of spacemen (i.e., by profession or by leisure). Extreme and unusual environments, and isolated and confined environments (EUE/ICE) are characterized by unique sensory stimulation. They are known to have negative effects on human psychology, cognitive abilities and physiology, threatening the outcome of space missions or travel. In addition, with the construction of the future Gateway base, the upcoming colonies to Mars and space tourism, travel from one point to another will be much more frequent. These raise new questions that will have to be addressed, whether it is the prolonged duration of a stay in a microgravity environment (i.e., absence of gravitational force between man and his support), in partial gravity and thus the issue of recovery from one trip to the next. These modifications of the environment imply the implementation of several adaptation processes to preserve the homeostatic capacity of the organism. This allows the organism to maintain a relatively stable internal state that persists despite external changes. Nevertheless, many questions remain unanswered. One such question is the impact of repeated changes in gravity during flight to the point of attachment (e.g., colony). The objective of the study is therefore to better understand the relationship between the body and its environment due to repeated changes in gravity, including microgravity.\n\nBeyond that, these results will contribute to enrich the knowledge of this real human challenge that is the question of the adaptation of the human being to the constraints of space travel."
