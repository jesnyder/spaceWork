The interest lies in endothelial cell (EC) and macrophage cell interactions. The investigators are proposing to first understand how microgravity effects the macrophage and EC function or pro-healing capabilities. Next, the study team plans to develop a 3D tissue regeneration model in which macrophages and ECs are co-cultured in a hydrogel matrix. Utilizing this model, the team will assess how microgravity influenced macrophage-EC interactions in 3D. The investigators will assess EC tubule volume (or blood vessel development), macrophage spreading and the interactions with endothelial tubule sprouts. This model will serve as a critical foundation for future grant opportunities as it allows the assessment of tissue regeneration and vascular health in a 3D tissue microenvironment"

                                   "One of the major issues in space explorations is the negative effect of prolonged exposure to very low gravity (i.e. a condition often referred to as microgravity or weightlessness) on astronauts' health. In this unusual condition the human body undergoes an adaptation process, often referred to as \"deconditioning\", that leads to significant loss of bone and muscle mass, hormonal changes, as well as modifications of important cardiovascular parameters. While the new physiological state is adequate to the microgravity environment, it results unsuitable upon return on earth. Hence after the mission astronauts experience various health-related problems and must undertake an intense rehabilitation program. Cardiovascular deconditioning originates mainly from a shift of blood from the lower extremities to the upper part of the body caused by the absence of gravity. In the long term (i.e. days) this causes a loss of blood and body fluid. In the short term (i.e. minutes) it elicits modifications to arterial blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nIn this study, funded by the European Union through the project STAMAS, we intend to evaluate whether leg physical exercises can lead to a displacement of blood towards the lower extremities, therefore ameliorating the upward fluid shift caused by weightlessness. More generally, we aim to investigate the short-term response of the cardiovascular system to leg exercises in microgravity-like conditions. After a clear understanding of these phenomena we will develop a controller that, by monitoring the physiological stare of a subject, will compute the appropriate exercise regime to stabilize his/her cardiovascular parameters to desired safe values. Our contribution will provide a better understanding of the cardiovascular system, and will delineate the physiological ground for the development of novel countermeasure devices against the cardiovascular deconditioning during space flight based on continuous leg exercises.\n\nThe protocol we propose in this document presents minimal risks for our potential subjects, while has the potential to produce important contributions. The cardiovascular parameters we intend to analyse are: blood pressure, heart rate and leg blood volume. These signals will be acquired non-invasively and with minimal risks. Leg exercises will be performed by means of a stepping device (MARCOS) previously developed in our Lab. MARCOS enables to vary the resistance applied against knee-extension movements, and therefore it allows a systematic evaluation of different exercise intensities. Finally, microgravity conditions can be easily emulated by letting the subjects lay on a tilted platform with head-down (i.e. head-down bed rest - HDBR, or head-down tilt - HDT) during the exercise sessions, thus inducing a shift of body fluid toward the thorax. The most effective inclination angle has proved to be as low as -6\u00b0, thus constituting only minimal risks for the subjects. In practice, subjects will comfortably lay on the negatively tilted platform and will perform stepping at different intensities while their cardiovascular parameters are being monitored and recorded in encrypted form for subsequent analysis."

There are tests that can be done to tell researchers more about the human body, such as a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, which measures body composition (fat and lean body mass). The use of muscle testing and a Handgrip test can tell us about the strength and power within an individual's muscles. A VO2 max test helps us understand the aerobic fitness level of an individual and one of the most important aspects of this study are muscle cells. A muscle biopsy allows us to obtain muscle cells from the thigh, which will be sent into space by a rocket. Researchers will study these muscle cells in a low gravity environment aboard the International Space Station. Studying the muscle cells under those conditions will potentially mimic an accelerated aging process, which will help researchers better understand muscle wasting in the elderly."

The results from this experiment have been published in the literature: the influence of respiration have been demonstrated and the signal processing methodology for the reconstruction of the displacement in one cardiac cycle have been developed. A 3D-BCG sensor has been developed and a collaboration to perform a sustained microgravity experiment onboard the Russian segment of ISS has been initiated. To be integrated in the PNEUMOCARD device, this new sensor needs to be tested in microgravity before implemented on ISS.\n\nThe aim of the present parabolic flight study is to serve as a feasibility demonstrator and test bed in order to evaluate the feasibility of 3D-BCG in sustained microgravity and to test whether the sensitivity of the developed 3D-BCG sensor is appropriate"

                                   "When astronauts return from space flight, they manifest a set of symptoms, the most striking of which is orthostatic intolerance, that is, the inability to stay upright. This orthostatic intolerance is related to cardiovascular adaptation and disappears in a few days, but the prospect of long-term space travel makes this maladaptation a major concern of space agencies, at a time when there is serious consideration to make \" land \"a ship on Mars.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that brain vessel adaptation may contribute to spatial post-flight orthostatic intolerance. The question remains controversial because not all studies are consistent. These studies are all based on the measurement of blood flow in a single artery of the brain (the average cerebral, see cerebral circulation diagram) easily accessible with a Doppler ultrasound machine. Our team has good reason to believe that the adaptation of the cerebral vessels is not carried out in the same way in all the arteries of the brain and that in particular the arteries that irrigate the posterior and inferior parts of the brain are a major determinant. from cerebrovascular adaptation to orthostatism and that orthostatic intolerance is more specifically related to a decrease in blood flow in these arteries. On the other hand our team has shown that the external carotid artery plays, under certain conditions, a buffer role of the sudden variations of perfusion pressure of the brain.\n\nDuring the weightless phase of parabolic flight, part of the blood from the legs and abdomen \"rises\" to the thorax and this transfer of fluid induces changes in blood pressure and cardiac output that affect the cerebral circulation. From a cardiovascular point of view, it is the same thing for a seated subject to lie down, but the parabolic flight offers the unique possibility of achieving this transfer in a fraction of a second and thus allowing to study the immediate response of the cerebral circulation. .\n\nInvestigators goal is therefore to quantify the changes in blood flow in the posterior and anterior territories of the brain (transcranial ultrasound) as well as in the internal carotid and vertebral (Doppler ultrasound) during changes in blood pressure and cardiac output induced by transfers. liquid resources associated with the transition to weightlessness.\n\nThe oxidative stress generated by weightlessness has been identified as a determining factor in cerebrovascular deconditioning associated with orthostatic intolerance. In order to quantify the biochemical markers of this stress, a venous sample will be taken before and just after the parabolic flight."

                                   "Physical activity appears to be an important lifestyle habit to achieve healthy aging by promoting autonomy and quality of life. Interestingly, the dramatic changes that the human body undergoes due to bedrest for illnesses and hospitalization are similar to those seen over decades of normal aging. Bedrest in otherwise healthy older individuals can lead to a reduction of muscle size and strength, changes in bone strength and function of the heart and blood vessels. Bedrest can also lead to changes in keeping proper balance as well as changes in processing and understanding information. All of these factors negatively affect activities of daily living leading to physical function impairment and development of frailty, a clinical condition associated with an increased risk for disease and death.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether exercise can counteract the negative effects of 2-week head tilt down bed rest on muscle function and metabolism, postural control, bone structure, orthostatic tolerance and cognitive function in adults.\n\nFor this study the investigators will recruit 24 healthy men and women between 55 - 65 years of age. All subjects will spend a total of 26 days (5 days of adaption period, 14 days of bed rest with 6 degrees of downward inclination, and 7 days of recovery period) at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC). During this study, 12 subjects will randomly undergo an exercise intervention as countermeasure during the 14 days of bed rest period and 12 will serve as control.\n\nEach subjects participation in this study will involve 1 telephone call (pre-screening) and 4 visits at the MUHC: 1 screening visit (Visit 1) followed by a 26-day long visit (Visit 2) and 2 follow-up visits (Visit 3 and Visit 4). During Visits 2 - 4 various measurements will be performed to assess sensorimotor control, muscle function and metabolism, bone structure, cardiovascular function, cognitive performance and function, and specimen collection (blood, urine, saliva, feces and muscle tissue)."

One potential problem with long duration, manned space flight is muscle loss- including loss of heart muscle. One goal of our research is to help identify why this muscle loss occurs. We are interested in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery because this procedure is performed to correct a problem with the valve that may also change heart function. This change in heart function may provide information that is useful in understanding and potentially preventing the loss of cardiac muscle in space.\n\nThree patient groups will be studied, patients having surgery for aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and coronary bypass. We are planing to perform this study on 30 patients, 10 in each group.\n\nThe aim of this study is to continue our ongoing study of the magnitude and predictors of the changes in size of the left ventricle following acute volume and pressure unloading as a ground-based analog for manned space flight."

                                   "Although most ground studies showed that an egocentric reference frame better supports spatial orientation, it is not proven it will be the same during weightlessness.\n\nAlthough it might justify that visuomotor performance will be better supported by egocentric target cueing under altered gravity conditions, the fact that exocentric target cueing induces less head movements and called for least attentional and physiological workload could be the key factors for a more efficient task localization process. Moreover, weightlessness can induce spatial disorientation, which can be additionally influenced by the intrinsic and extrinsic spatial reference frames (Gurfinkel et al., 1993; Glasauer & Mittelst\u00e4dt, 1997, 1998; Harm et al., 1998; Lipshits et al. 2005). We expect that during weightlessness the workload will be the key factor and thus we hypothesize that an exocentric target cueing will outperform egocentric target cueing.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, and find out which presentation scheme for target cueing (EGO, EXO, ED) contributes most to an efficient visual search, performance to a visuomotor task will be evaluated during parabolic flights in normogravity (1g), hypergravity (1.8g) and microgravity (0g). The visuomotor performance will be assessed by a multi-directional tapping task as defined by ISO9241-9, which requests for motor responses by aimed pointing movements. Besides analyzing the pointing performance, different workload indices will be additionally assessed to evaluate the effort spent on visuomotor coordination. The attentional workload will be evaluated by the performance of a secondary task (visual reaction-time task), which needs to be conducted in parallel to the visuomotor task. Furthermore, the workload will be also assessed subjectively by the NASA TLX rating scale and physiologically, by analyzing the heart rate variability (HRV)."

Dry immersion involves immersing the subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric. As a result, the immersed subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains dry. Within a relatively short duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most physiological effects of actual microgravity, including centralization of body fluids, support unloading, and hypokinesia.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the physiological changes induced by 5 days of dry immersion in the female organism. The main physiological systems will be explored before, during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific tests and measurements. The results will be analyzed by scientists specializing in each field in order to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare its effects with those of the bedrest model and those of spaceflight. The clinical (adverse effects, comfort of subjects) and operational aspects are also part of the secondary objectives of the study."

                                   "Head down tilt (HDT) was widely used to simulate microgravity effects on cardiovascular system. HDT could be a suitable model of water immersion (WI) which is also used to simulate the cardiovascular effects of microgravity and which is not easy to study in laboratory. To define the possibility to simulate immersion by HDT, a comparison between these models is required. A comparison between WI and few angles during HDT seems necessary to understand which angle is more adapt.\n\nThe immersion induces an increase of the central blood volume. This increase is caused by a redistribution of blood from peripheral portions of the body to the intrathoracic circulation. It seems to load cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptors. These baroreceptors bring into play autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation and induce a bradycardia.\n\nHDT induces an increase in central blood volume as supported by the central venous pressure and cardiac volume increase and in return, MSNA and heart rate decrease. These cardiovascular effects seem to be the same as the thermoneutral immersion and suggest that the ANS activation is the same during HDT and WI.\n\nNevertheless, a few previous studies about ANS in HDT indicate some discordant results: a sympathetic decrease was reported but several results show an increase of parasympathetic activity linked with a trend of increase of arterial baroreflex. The aim of this study is to assess ANS activity in HDT on different angles (-6\u00b0 and -15\u00b0) and WI. The investigators suppose an increase of parasympathetic activity during WI corresponding to parasympathetic activation during HDT especially at -6\u00b0."

                                   "The human being has shown that he can live and work in the space environment, but due to the lack of essential mechanical load on muscle and bone, the fluid-shift as well as alterations in the acid-base balance (mainly on account of nutritional factors), the exposure to microgravity results in a gradual degradation of muscle, bone and cartilage, deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and metabolic changes. Countermeasures to prevent all the deconditioning of the physiological systems are not yet fully effective and require further investigation.\n\nA commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the human organism on ground is the 6\u00b0 head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning.\n\nOne of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context: supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting.\n\nDrawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation. Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the acidogenic properties need to be compensated. As previous works suggest, a shift of acid base balance into the acid direction and the resulting changes in bone and protein turnover may be hindered by supplementing alkaline mineral salts.\n\nIn this regard, a mid-term bed rest study was performed in order to investigate the effect of a combined whey protein (0.6 g/kg body weight/day) and potassium bicarbonate (90 mmol/day) supplementation as a potential countermeasure to multiple physiological and metabolic alterations on the human body resulting from real and simulated microgravity."

                                   "Previous studies have neglected two important aspects for the China National Space Administration. First, while biomechanical models are very sensitive to the characteristics of the subjects, data have been collected on subjects with biomechanical characteristics very different from those of \"typical\" Chinese astronauts. Second, pure video analysis techniques and kinematic data lack the necessary acceleration information important to understanding the forces exerted during movement and control of human motion. While some studies used force and moment sensors to aid in robot torque control and human joint work estimation, investigators are unaware of any studies performed in a microgravity environment that have combined the kinetic force and moment information with acceleration measurements to enable more reliable motion tracking without the need for acceleration estimation.\n\nThis is why MICR0-G sensors and accompanying kinematic video system have been developed in order to provide for detailed analyses of the astronaut movement control strategy (joint forces and torques, kinetic and acceleration measurements). Knowledge of the joint torques permits us to calculate the joint and musculoskeletal dynamics required to execute the microgravity motions, as well to provide insight into the altered movement strategies in reduced gravity as compared to 1-G locomotion."

                                   "Recently, new clinical testing of saccular and utricular function have been developed and validated, the so-called vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials - VEMP (Brantberg et al. 2009, Cornell et al. 2009, Curthoys 2010, Manzari et al. 2012). Among them, the cervical VEMP (cVEMP) are short-latency electromyographic (EMG) modulations of the contracted sternocleidomastoid muscles in responses to vibration applied on the forehead. The clinical literature suggests that cVEMP are almost entirely saccular in origin (Halmagyi et al 1995).\n\nThe aim of our research is to evaluate changes in the otolith function in microgravity and hypergravity using this clinical test. Cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) will be recorded by surface EMG electrodes in response to bone conducted vibration to specifically assess saccular function (Halmagyi et al 1995). The primary measures will include muscle activity response amplitudes and the stimulus intensity threshold at which the cVEMP is detected.\n\nGiven that there is an off-loading of the saccules in microgravity and an increased loading in hypergravity, we hypothesize that there will be a reduction in cVEMP amplitude in microgravity and an increase in cVEMP amplitude in hypregravity compared to normal gravity. These changes in amplitude will be accompanied by changes in the threshold of the stimulus level required to elicit a cVEMP."

                                   "Spaceflight induces detrimental changes in most organ systems with both acute changes and chronic adaptations. For example, acute fluid shifts associated with weightlessness (also called - improperly - microgravity) cause initial rapid cardiovascular alterations, whereas the chronic changes are more reflective of cardiovascular deconditioning and cerebrovascular/ocular adaptations (Pavy-Le Traon et al., 2007).\n\nLong-duration stays in weightlessness have resulted in ocular structural and functional adaptations in some astronauts, which has been termed the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS ; see review in Lee et al., 2018). The leading hypothesis is that ocular changes are the consequence of chronic exposure to the weightlessness-induced headward (cephalad) fluid shift experienced by all astronauts. Countermeasures targeted to reverse this fluid shift, including lower body negative pressure and veno-occlusive thigh cuffs, have been proposed and tested in ground-based studies using a head-down tilt model of the cephalad fluid shift. However, the amount of fluid shift reversal required to prevent the development of SANS has not been investigated or determined. Similarly, artificial gravity through centrifugation has been proposed as a SANS countermeasure, given its ability to reverse headward fluid shifts and its efficacy as a countermeasure to long-duration bed rest-induced cardiovascular adaptations (long-duration bed rest is widely employed to simulate the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems). However, the minimum level of artificial gravity required also has not been investigated.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to characterize cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and ocular changes across a range of gravity levels to identify a threshold of gravitational load that can serve as a countermeasure to SANS during future spaceflight missions."

Space flight simulations such as prolonged bed rest can mimic some of these changes and provide study conditions that are more accessible than during space flight. The European Space Agency, ESA together with the French national space agency, CNES and the Japanese national space agency, NASDA are performing extensive studies using long duration bed rest.\n\nPrevious studies including several long and short term bed rest campaigns have yielded significant medical data on the physiological changes induced by space flight. These data can be used to study the effect of countermeasures, methods helping to prevent these physiological changes.\n\nThe long duration bed rest, lasting 3 months undertakes a variety of investigations involving 28 subjects. This study focuses on countermeasures, studying the effect of a bone tissue stabilisation medication and resistive exercises to determine their suitability for use during long duration stays on ISS.\n\nThe physiological changes recorded during space flight and bed rest mimic those observed in some diseases and in the aging process. Significant clinical applications are expected as a direct result of this experiment and future equivalent studies."

This project will provide data about the efficacy of lower body negative pressure to mimic daily upright posture by intermittently lowering central venous pressure while in simulated microgravity (3 days of bed rest). The investigators expect that 3 days of bed rest will increase choroid thickness, and choroid area. The investigators hypothesize that nightly LBNP (-20mmHg) will prevent these changes."

In order to induce muscle loss, participants will be required to lie flat on their back on a water bed filled with water and salt (called hyper-buoyancy flotation (HBF)). As this situation is similar to that experienced in space, the investigators will also measure the effect of HBF on sleep, brain and physiological function - all things known to change in astronauts. Sixteen male subjects (18-40 yrs) will be recruited to participate in the study that will require physiological testing before, during and following both 7 days of normal conditions and 7 days of HBF bed-rest. Each subject will be exposed to the same conditions and assessments over the study period. As some loss of muscle is expected, participants will be offered an exercise rehabilitation programme upon completion of HBF with self-monitored and/or guided sessions based on those provided by the Space Medicine Office of the European Space Agency to returning astronauts."

                                   "Computers now play an important role in the lives of most individuals.Access to computers is crucial for people with disabilities and may improve their quality of life. The use of computers can facilitate mainstreaming at school, for example, and the Internet may provide a valuable means of communication. However, the use of computers requires a certain degree of motor ability. People with motor disabilities frequently experience difficulties using a standard keyboard and standard pointing input systems such as a mouse. Many solutions exist to facilitate computer access, depending on the person's specific impairments and the purpose for which the computer is used. The most common solution relies on the use of a virtual keyboard which is directly displayed on the computer screen. The selection of the desired key on the virtual keyboard can be handled by a large variety of input devices, from a microgravity mouse to single switch devices supplemented by a process of dynamic scanning of the keyboard.Although such assistive devices render computers accessible to people with disabilities, the actual inputting of text can be very slow. A method to increase text input speed is to display words which are predicted from the letters previously typed. Word prediction reduces the number of necessary key strokes by avoiding having to type the whole word. The effect on text input speed is, however uncertain and results in the literature are inconclusive. Indeed, word prediction software provide a enhancement of cognitive load which decrease text input speed.The reduction of cognitive load could therefore be based in part on the optimization settings of the software and / or achievement of a rehabilitation program.Our hypothesis are for people with spinal cord injury : i) optimization settings word prediction software and ii) a rehabilitation program could improve the text input speed.The investigators propose to study the influence of settings word prediction software on text input speed and the influence of a rehabilitation program provided by a therapist, focused on word prediction software to help integrate them. The aim is to increase the performance of people with spinal cord injury and their satisfaction.\n\nThe first phase of this research is to select the word prediction software and configuration that provides the best user support.The second phase corresponds to the objective of evaluating the efficiency of a rehabilitation program ."

                                   "Kinocardiographic measures mechanical and electrical function of the heart. The proposed solution is based on measurements of body vibrations. By measuring these movements on the surface of the body, it is possible to deduce, taking into account the individual's weight and size, the quality of the heartbeat that caused this vibration. The technique developed consists of a device measuring these vibrations at two places in the body: on the torso (Seismocardiography) and on the lower back (Ballistocardiography). The first measurement is a reflection of the local strength of the heartbeat as well as the transmission of blood to the body's main artery, the aorta. The second measurement, in the lower back, is the result of the contraction and movement of blood within the arterial system. Based on these two measurements, the energy produced by the heart and transmitted to the torso or the whole body is calculated. The energy over an entire cardiac cycle and the distribution of that energy within a heartbeat are used to characterize the mechanical function of the heart.\n\nClinical studies carried out previously have demonstrated the repeatability of kinocardiographic measurements (KCG) and their robustness with respect to the use of different sensors.\n\nKCG measurements also showed a high sensitivity (> 94%) to different hemodynamic states induced by the injection of active inotropic agents, i.e. dobutamine also used as a treatment for heart failure in an advanced stage. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study controlled by Placebo, these measurements showed a strong correlation (r = 0.8, p <0.0001) with cardiac output measured by echocardiography. The technique has also demonstrated its ability to track changes in cardiac mechanical function during expiratory voluntary apnea.\n\nKCG measurements were also evaluated during a micro-gravity simulation in Bedrest on 23 healthy volunteers. The measurements tracked cardiac deconditioning in the control group compared to the exercise group similarly to cardiac MRI measurements. Subsequently, KCG metrics showed an ability to distinguish reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) heart failure patients from non-insufficient patients. These latest results also showed that the chest sensor alone was sufficient to separate HFrEF patients from normative patients, laying the foundation for possible use of the smartphone alone.\n\nThe prototype of a mobile application, named OKCARDIO, makes it possible to take measurements perfectly similar to the Kino thoracic sensor, but to date have never been used it in a clinical study. Such a tool would allow anyone with a smartphone-type mobile phone to measure their cardiac mechanical function themselves and make it available to the attending physician."

In addition to the 0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present another unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.\n\nCognitive function, together with good oculomotor control, eye-hand coordination, and spatial orientation perception, is a critical subsystem that is used by the CNS in the control of vehicles and other complex systems in a high-level integrative function. Evidence from space flight research demonstrates that the function of each of these subsystems is altered by the transitions in gravito-inertial force levels. These neuro-vestibular alterations, unfortunately, correspond to mission phases where physical and cognitive performance are particularly critical for crew safety and mission success. To date, there is only limited operational evidence that these alterations cause functional impacts on mission-critical vehicle (or complex system) control capabilities. However, the true operational risks will be estimable only after the investigators have filled the knowledge gaps and when the investigators can accurately assess integrated performance in off-nominal operational settings.\n\nAccurate perception of self-in-space motion and self-motion relative to other objects are critical to piloting, driving, and remote manipulator operations. Immediately after space flight, most crewmembers have reported some degree of disorientation/perceptual illusion, often accompanied by nausea (or other symptoms of motion sickness), and frequently manifested by lack of coordination, particularly during locomotion. Despite recent, intensive training, some Shuttle landings were outside of the desired performance boundaries. Scores indicating neurovestibular dysfunction in returning astronauts generally correlated with poorer flying performances, including a lower approach and landing shorter, faster, and harder. An underestimation of distance, coupled to an overestimation of tilt magnitude or misperception of the type of motion, could be at the origin of these poorer performances.\n\nThis study should confirm that the unloading of the otoliths in weightlessness induces an alteration in the egocentric reference during space flight. Errors in egocentric localization might contribute at a higher level to the computation of misleading world-centered representations, and therefore be partly responsible for illusory sensations and motion sickness symptoms during space flight, and postural instability and oscillopsia after returning in a reduced or terrestrial gravitational force level.\n\nBeside their fundamental implications, the results of this study have also practical implications in the design of man-machine interfaces. Changes in judgment of distance in microgravity or in reduced gravity affect crew posture and reach, display orientation, and other visual cues, which should be considered in hardware and operations design."
