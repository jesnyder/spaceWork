A commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the human organism on ground is the 6° head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning.

One of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context: supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting.

Drawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation. Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the acidogenic properties need to be compensated.

Subjects sat on a chair on a moving platform on top of a centrifuge that created an artificial gravity environment. Subjects were repeatedly roll tilted to angles between 11 and 19 degrees, and then reported their perceived tilt angle using a subjective visual vertical task. They did this while experiencing centripetal acceleration equivalent to Earth gravity (1 Gz), and then hypogravity (0.5 Gz). We hypothesized that, after entering hypogravity, subjects would tend to underestimate their tilt angle. We calculated the percent change in their perception of tilt between 1 Gz and 0.5 Gz. This is a perceptual self-motion threshold that measures the precision of the vestibular system. It is analogous to an audiogram, but for motion. Subjects sat on a motorized platform which repeatedly provided them with small motions to the left or right. After each motion subjects report whether they perceived a motion to the left or right. Based on subject responses, a psychometric curve fit is performed that determines the threshold (the standard deviation of the underlying cumulative Gaussian). Yaw rotation means rotations about an axis that is perpendicular to gravity.  This outcome measure applies only to arm 5 subjects.

They did this while experiencing centripetal acceleration equivalent to Earth gravity (1 Gz), and then hypogravity (0.5 Gz). We calculated their performance by calculating the standard deviation of chair position across time, with a smaller number indicating better performance.

To use neuroimaging, polysomnography and cognitive battery to investigate any structural (MR brain), neurophysiological (PSG/EEG) and functional (rs-fMRI and CANTAB battery test) central nervous system changes induced by the intervention To determine the change in single muscle fibre cross-sectional area, using immunohistochemical staining, compared to total quadriceps cross-sectional area using ultrasound. Myofiber cross-sectional area will be measured using muscle biopsy tissue which will be mounted onto cork and cut into 5 μm-thick cryosections. Immunohistochemical stainings of muscle tissue cross sections will then measured using a microscope. To determine the change in biochemical (protein:DNA ratio) markers of quadriceps size in relation to the MRI and ultrasound measurements To determine the relationship between change in quadriceps skeletal muscle mass (measured by MRI) and change in fractional protein synthesis (FPS) rate measured using tracer (D2O) techniques To investigate changes of anabolic and catabolic signalling markers (such as MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1) in quadriceps muscle after 7 days HBF To measure changes in muscle function as a result of 7 days HBF. These will include maximal voluntary isometric strength of the knee extensors, plantar flexors in the trunk and hand (hand grip) and explosive power during a countermovement jump. To measure changes in cardio respiratory fitness (maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max)) with 7 days of immobilisation To measure changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of before and after a 7 days HBF To determine the effect of 7 day HBF upon plantar flexion power output using an isokinetic dynamometer To determine the effect of 7-day HBF upon the viscoelastic properties of superficial muscles and the Achilles tendon using Myoton.The viscoelastic properties of relaxed arm flexor, arm extensor, erector spinae, lateral gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon will be determined at rest (HBF) using the Myoton (hand-held myometer) on day 1, day 3, day 5 and day 7 (last day) of the HBF. This will be done by applying a short (15ms) and almost imperceptible mechanical impulse (force 0.4N) applied directly to the skin. The following parameters are derived from the oscillation acceleration signal generated by the mechanical impulse in real time by the Myoton's software: 1) Dynamic stiffness: which indicates the resistance to deformation of a tissue, 2) Oscillation frequency: which indicates the (muscle) tone or intrinsic tension of a tissue, 3) The logarithmic decrement of the oscillation: which characterises tissue elasticity.

In this context, we expect alterations in the microcirculatory flow during the weightlessness period of parabolic flight.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) of IgM heavy chain transcripts extracted from PBMC will 1) indicate if the expression frequencies of Ig gene segments are modified during bed rest thereby indicating a change in B lymphopoiesis (because each B cell created in the marrow is characterized by its own VH-D-JH-Cµ mRNA) and 2) allow the assessment of the activities of enzymes required for the formation of the B cell antigen receptor repertoire.  Flow cytometry will be used to determine if there is an egress of HSC/progenitors from the bone marrow into blood stream thereby indicating a decrease of the interactions between HSC and their niche. The same technique will be used to determine if there are changes in B cell subsets in peripheral blood. Mass spectrometry will be performed on proteins obtained from muscle biopsies, microdialysis and serum. The generated peptides will be analysed using high resolution mass shot-gun mass spectrometry. The end point is a reduction in muscle pump indices: a) decrease in causality between EMG and Blood pressure, b) decrease in gain between EMG and Blood pressure, and c) decrease in the interaction time between EMG and Blood pressure. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance will be assessed during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp.  Whole blood will be immediately analyzed for glucose concentration, serum insulin will be quantified by radioimmunoassay and catecholamines will be quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Peripheral insulin sensitivity will be calculated during the final hour of the clamp in steady state. Both structural and functional brain changes associated with head-down bedrest will be examined by 3T MRI. Imaging sequence parameters will be selected to maximize sensitivity to effects of interest. Subjects perform a video game-like task of shooting a projectile out of a hand-held tool so that it passes between the gaps of an oriented target grill. Since the projectile and the tool are long and narrow, the subject must place the tool at the same orientation as the grill to achieve success. On certain trials, the subject is required to move the head between the time that the target is acquired and the moment of the response. Trials vary in terms of what the subject can see and feel during the execution of the task, and on body posture.  A 3D motion caption system is used to track in real-time the movements of the subject' head and hands. A virtual reality helmet is used to provide visual and audio information. A moving head support will be used to allow the subject to tilt the head laterally in both seated and laying conditions. Change in pulse wave velocity in carotid and femoral arteries will be assessed by non-invasive ultrasound measurements. Within-subjects changes in adipose gene expression between intervention groups will be evaluated using RNAseq Measurement of changes to objective sleep will be determined using continuous 24-h EEG monitoring at regular intervals throughout the protocol (including baseline, head down tilt, and recovery). Changes in subjective sleep quality will be measured using the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) four times per day (mealtimes and bed time) doing every day of the protocol. Changes to the circadian rhythms of melatonin and cortisol will be measured by radioimmunoassay on saliva samples taken hourly throughout the day at regular intervals throughout the protocol (including baseline, head down tilt, and recovery; same as for EEG). Changes to the circadian rhythmicity of the whole-blood transcriptome will be measured by whole-genome microarray analyses of RNA extracted from six 4-hourly blood samples taken over a 24-h period at regular intervals throughout the protocol (including baseline, head down tilt, and recovery; same as for EEG). Vastus Lateralis needle biopsies will be performed before, at the end of the Head Down Tilt period (after about 60 days of bedrest) and of the recovery phases. Change in levels of S-nitrosylated proteins will be measured in active vs. atrophic muscle following extended bed rest. Vastus Lateralis needle biopsies will be performed before, at the end of the Head Down Tilt period (after about 60 days of bedrest) and of the recovery phases. Change in skeletal muscle gene expression will be analyzed by microarray technology. Bone resorption marker CTX will be analyzed in the aliquots of total 24h-urine, collected at different timepoints of the study (pre, during and after the bedrest phase). Energy substrates labeled with stable (non radioactive) isotopes will be used to measure intermediary metabolism and fluxes. In a healthy standing subject, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) evokes a postural sway response directed towards the anode electrode. The direction of the response is fixed in head coordinates and so it will rotate as the head is turned. To determine if bedrest has affected the accuracy and precision of this sway response, we will measure the direction of the ground reaction force (GRF) response evoked by GVS in standing volunteers under different head orientations. The mean direction (accuracy) along with the trial-to-trial variability (precision) of the GRF vector will be separately determined. Any reduction in accuracy or precision will indicate degraded vestibular control of balance. 24h ECG Holters will be done at different timepoints of the study (pre, during and after the bedrest phase). A conventional Holter analysis will be performed using dedicated commercial software. Moreover, the recordings obtained will be analyzed using several advanced signal processing techniques, which will be focused on different aspects of ventricular repolarization. |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in vertebral bone marrow fat fraction.

The lower reference limit for normal forms is 4% (WHO 2010). The percentage of live spermatozoa is assessed by identifying those with an intact cell membrane, from dye exclusion. The lower reference limit for vitality (membrane-intact spermatozoa) is 58% (WHO 2010). Sperm DNA fragmentation is evaluated by Halosperm® kit, based on the SCD technique, patented by Halotech. This kit is based on a controlled DNA denaturation process to facilitate the subsequent removal of the proteins contained in each spermatozoon. In this way, normal spermatozoa create halos formed by loops of DNA at the head of the sperm, which are not present in those with damaged DNA.  Thresholds for frequency of Sperm DNA Fragmentation (SDF) have been suggested by Dr. Evenson et al. (Evenson and Nixon, Reprod Biomed Online 12:466-472, 2006). The authors reported that couples with no known infertility problems were more likely to achieve a pregnancy/delivery if the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) was <30%. Annexin V recognizes an antigen (externalized phosphatidylserine, EPS) in the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic cell depletion begins with the magnetic labeling of apoptotic cells by the MACS® ART Annexin V Reagent. The labeled cells are then passed through a separation column located in a fixed magnetic field. Unwanted cells are selectively retained in the column. Living spermatozoa are not labeled by the reagent, so they pass through the column and are collected for later use.  In our study, after collecting living spermatozoa we also collected the retained apoptotic spermatozoa for comparing the concentration (M/ml) of apoptotic vs no apoptotic cells. |  PrimaryOutcomeMeasure:  Change in Sperm motility Change Sperm Morphology Change Sperm Vitality Change in Sperm DNA Fragmentation Change Sperm APOPTOSIS (Annexin V ) |  PrimaryOutcomeTimeFrame:  In earth gravity g=1(<4 hours before Parabolic flight) and after simulated microgravity exposure (<4 hours Post Parabolic Flight) In earth gravity g=1(<4 hours before Parabolic flight) and after simulated microgravity exposure (<4 hours Post Parabolic Flight) In earth gravity g=1(<4 hours before Parabolic flight) and after simulated microgravity exposure (<4 hours Post Parabolic Flight) In earth gravity g=1(<4 hours before Parabolic flight) and after simulated microgravity exposure (<4 hours Post Parabolic Flight) In earth gravity g=1(<4 hours before Parabolic flight) and after simulated microgravity exposure (<4 hours Post Parabolic Flight) |  SecondaryOutcomeDescription:   |  SecondaryOutcomeMeasure:   |  SecondaryOutcomeTimeFrame:   | ",Male,18 Years - 45 Years,Not Applicable,30,OTHER,Interventional, , ,"November 20, 2018","December 1, 2021","December 31, 2021","November 15, 2018",,"March 31, 2022",OTHER,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT03760783," the effects of microgravity on human sperm the effects of microgravity on human spermit has been described that microgravity affects cellular and molecular structures. cell membrane, cytoskeleton, cytoplasm and nucleus have been found to be sensible to gravitational changes. alterations in the male and female reproductive systems have also been reported in mouse and other animals. the effects of microgravity on human reproductive cells remain unknown.  the main objective of this experimental study is to investigate the effect of simulated microgravity in human male reproductive cells under in vitro conditions. induced microgravity conditions will be obtained with a smaller single-engine aerobatic aircraft that can provide parabolic flights.  the main parameters to be analyzed are: sperm motility, vitality, dna fragmentation and apoptosis. other: parabolic flight single group assignment    effect of microgravity on human sperm       sperm analysis (total motility m/ml; grade a+b sperm m/ml, vitality, dna frag and apoptosis) will be measured on ground at 1g before the flight and after flight were sperm samples have been exposed to simulated microgravity   parabolic flight  other","It has been described that microgravity affects cellular and molecular structures.

Nitrogen intake is calculated with a nutrition software. Protein oxidation measured in the 24-Hour urine collection estimates nitrogen output Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is a standard clinical technique to assess fat (g) and lean (g) body mass. Glucose and insulin levels will be measured at baseline (fasting) and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after drinking within 5 min a water solution containing 75 g of glucose Measured by electronic ingestible temperature capsules (e-Celsius Performance) Measured in supine and standing position Transcranial Doppler measurements Change in mood is assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. POMS questionnaire gives 6 measures of mood:  Tension/anxiety, Depression, Anger/hostility Dynamism, Fatigue, Confusion A Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score is calculated by summing the totals for the negative subscales (tension, depression, fatigue, confusion, anger) and then subtracting the totals for the positive subscale (vigor /esteem-related affect). Positive and Negative Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire will be used to assess the intensity of positive and negative affective states. PANAS self-report questionnaire consists of two 10-item scales to measure both positive and negative affects  Each item is rated on a five-point Likert Scale, ranging from 1 = Not at all to 5 = Extremely, to measure the extent to which the affect has been experienced in a specified time frame.  Positive affects: scores can range from 10 - 50 with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect.  Negative affects: scores can range from 10 - 50 with higher scores representing higher levels of negative affect. Pittsburgh Sleep Dairy (PghSD) will be used to assess sleep perceived quality. The PghSD is an instrument with separate components to be completed at bedtime and waketime. The following parameters are registered or assessed:  Bedtime, waketime, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, mode of awakening and ratings of sleep quality, mood, and alertness on wakening, as well as daytime information on naps, exercise, meals and caffeine, tobacco and medications use. General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) will be used to assess psychological well-being and capture distress  GHQ-28 gives an overall total score and 4 scores for 4 subscales:  Somatic symptoms, Anxiety/insomnia, Social dysfunction, Severe depression. Higher scores indicate higher levels of distress Brief Cope Questionnaire is designed to measure effective and ineffective ways to cope with a stressful life event, and will be used to assess coping strategies. The Brief Cope is a shortened form (28 items) of the Carver and Scheier COPE inventory.  There are 14 coping strategies. These strategies can be then gathered in two main categories : approach coping and avoidance coping.
