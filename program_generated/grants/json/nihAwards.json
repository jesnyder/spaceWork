                        "Public Health Relevance": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nUnderstanding the effects of extreme environments such as space travel on human heart tissues is hampered\nby the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models that can mimic clinical conditions from the patient\u2019s own\ncells. Patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes self-assembled into\nmulticellular, three-dimensional structures in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix offer an excellent\nsurrogate to recapitulate normal physiology and disease. In this UG3/UH3 proposal, we aim to generate an\nethnically diverse heart tissue array for drug screening in patient groups that manifest severe phenotype after\nexposure to microgravity in space.",
