Conventional two-\ndimensional (2-D) mammalian cell culture does not represent the physiological environments that form the\nbasis for normal cell function. A 3-D environment promotes isotropic cell-cell communications, provides\nextracellular guidance from structural matrix scaffolding, and allows spatiotemporal remodelling. Our specific\ninterest is in investigating the effects of microgravity on heart function with the use of Engineered Heart\nTissues (EHTs). Since these tissue engineering platforms support multicellular architecture from a \u2018bottom-\nup\u2019 approach, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of heart development from a primordial state.\nAlthough animal models are used widely to investigate biological responses to therapeutics, inherent\ndifferences between human and animal biology combined with the unlikelihood of animals developing a\nhuman disease limit the ability to validate research findings. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)\nhave emerged as an indispensable tool to drive cells from an embryonic state to any somatic cell type. Our\nlaboratory\u2019s focus and expertise in generating hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and modelling of\ncardiomyopathies has yielded deeper insight into several rare and common causes of heart failure. To\nmaintain a tissue-specific microenvironment, dissociated cells must be cultured in a physiologically relevant\n3-D extracellular matrix (ECM). In the first phase (UG3), we will generate hiPSC-CMs from healthy patients\nbelonging to diverse racial groups (Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans). The hiPSC-CMs will be\nused to fabricate our well-characterized EHT platforms, to understand cellular mechanisms that affect cardiac\nfunction both under microgravity and earth\u2019s gravity. Alterations in cardiac function due to weakened heart\nmuscles in the samples exposed to microgravity will be matched with molecular and electrophysiological\ndisease patterns observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the second phase (UH3), the well-characterized\nmicrogravity-induced disease phenotype will be translated on Heart Tissue Arrays (HTA) to screen for\npotential drug candidates in a high-throughput manner. The proposed study will for the first time reveal key\nfunctional and molecular differences that drive phenotypic changes in heart tissues on EHT assemblies under\ninfluence of microgravity.",

As we plan\nfor exploration class missions that will see humans spend longer periods of time in space, such as in a manned\nmissions to Mars, the potential impact of spaceflight on the heart and cardiovascular system will likely be\nincreased. Additionally, the effects of spaceflight on the human body appear to mimic an accelerated aging\nprocess. Given that heart disease is the number one killer of all adults in the U.S., an understanding of the\ncardiogenic effects of microgravity may have implications for helping to treat millions of heart disease patients\non Earth. Unfortunately, much is still unknown regarding the effect of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system\nand the heart in particular. To address this issue, we will develop a high-throughput microphysiological model of\nhuman cardiac muscle, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), in order to study the effects\nof microgravity on cardiac tissue structure and physiological function. We will combine this cell source with a\ncardiac-specific decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based electroconductive composite scaffold to\npromote the maturation of cultured cells. The technologies developed during this study will facilitate the\ngeneration of mature 3D engineered cardiac tissues that recapitulate the microarchitecture and function of\nhuman myocardium. The data collected using this platform aboard the International Space Station (ISS) will\nprovide a better understanding of how prolonged microgravity affects the structure and function of the human\nheart. During the UG3 phase of this proposal, we will assess differences in cardiac function and physiological\nmaturation between cells maintained in normal gravity and microgravity environments. Engineered heart tissues\n(EHTs) made from hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes will be flown aboard the ISS for one month and be compared\nto identical ground controls. Real-time assessment of EHT contractility will be achieved via a novel magnetic\ncoil-based motion sensor array, facilitating real-time and continuous assessment of function with minimal\ndemands from the flight crew. Progressing to the UH3 phase, we will focus on the assessment of novel\ntherapeutic strategies with which to attenuate microgravity-induced cardiomyopathy. We will assess both drug\ncompounds and mechanical stimulation interventions and analyze each in isolation and in concert for their ability\nto improve cardiac function in space. The outcomes of this research could further improve our understanding of\nthe progression of chronic heart diseases on Earth, and help drive the development of new therapeutic strategies\nfor these debilitating conditions.\nProject Summary/Abstract Page 7",

                        "Project Abstract": "Abstract/ Project Summary\nThe increasing importance of technology in contemporary society necessitates a STEM literate population.\nThis represents a challenge for traditionally underrepresented populations (people of color, individuals with\ndisabilities, individuals in less affluent communities) impacting upward social mobility. Often, members of\nthese groups are doubly disadvantaged, as the few who become first generation college students often lack a\nroadmap for success through family, near peers and potential mentors. Success for this population,\nrepresenting a highly motivated group, needs to be nurtured to embrace and advance STEM disciplines,\nbefore they reach their college classrooms. This necessitates the education not only of students, but their\nteachers, providing synergies in teaching and learning to empower students to avail of opportunities perceived\nas being beyond their reach. We hypothesize that bridging this expanding gap requires an integrated program\nbringing together academic, social and real-world professional experiences to establish a pipeline linking\nsuccess in middle/high school to success for first generation college students and beyond. Such a pipeline will\ngenerate not only STEM-proficient citizens but also a cadre of near peers to motivate by example. With this\ncentral premise we have formed the STEM Through Authentic Research and Training (START) Program tot\nidentify recruit and retaining traditionally underrepresented populations by providing year-round authentic\nresearch opportunities and professional development for high school students (grades 9-12) and middle and\nsecondary STEM teachers (grades 5-12). START represents a partnership between the University of Kentucky\nproviding opportunities for STEM research, The Academies of Lexington, a partnership with the Fayette\nCounty Public Schools- focused on changing the traditional didactic model for STEM instruction, the KY-WV\nLSAMP program an NSF funded consortium led by UK including over 10 diverse academic institutions\nsupporting undergraduate research aimed at increasing the representation and overall success of traditionally\nunderrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. START establishes a natural pipeline to the collegiate\nlevel by virtue of the alliance with KY-WV LSAMP and its member institutions. Finally, we have recruited Space\nTango, a Lexington STEM start-up company which builds and integrates systems for scientific and biomedical\nresearch under microgravity conditions on the international space station. As such, a spectrum of research\nopportunities, from the molecular and microscopic level in participating UK STEM laboratories to the vastness\nof space itself afforded by Space Tango provide an exciting palate of opportunities for traditionally\nunderrepresented students and the teachers responsible for their STEM education. We believe that the\nintegration of real world authentic research opportunities in the context of overall STEM education via a unique\npartnership between academia, educational and commercial entities will motivate underrepresented student\npopulations to levels of achievement they often believe are beyond their horizons.",

The\ncombination of these two imaging modalities within the same imaging platform enables comprehensive\nassessment of blood flow in the retina and choroid. This novel imaging platform will enable imaging\nstudies in animals and human subjects with normal vision or with various retinal diseases. Prior PSI\nexperience in developing advanced ophthalmic imaging systems coupled with our collaborators' expertise\nin Ophthalmology will be leveraged to ensure the successful outcome of this important R&D program.\n A feasibility study will be performed during the Phase I program by imaging normal and diseased rodent\nmodels using a benchtop instrument. A clinical prototype instrument will be manufactured and tested\nclinically in Phase II in the NYU population of patients to highlight hemodynamic retinal biomarkers. We\nchoose to focus on diseases that are the leading causes of blindness including, age-related macular\ndegeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma to demonstrate the clinical utility of our novel\nsystem. We will recruit healthy individuals to set a reference, and subjects with AMD, DR, and glaucoma at\na wide range of disease severity.

                        "Project Abstract": "Defective bone mechanosensing and skeletal unloading contribute to age-related and disuse osteoporosis. The\nmolecular mechanisms that transduce the osteoblast response to physical forces in the bone microenvironment\nto maintain skeletal homeostasis are poorly understood. We discovered a novel mechanosensing complex in\nosteoblasts created by an interaction between polycystins (PC1, Pkd1 and PC2, Pkd2) and TAZ (transcriptional\ncoactivator with PDZ-binding motif). The PC1/PC2/TAZ complex functions to sense and transduce mechanical\nloading into anabolic bone responses. Loss of either Pkd1 or Taz in mice results in osteopenia characterized by\na reciprocal decrease in osteoblast-mediated bone formation and an increase in adipocytes in bone marrow.\nCompound heterozygous mice lacking one copy of Pkd1 and TAZ exhibit additive decrements in bone mass,\nimpaired osteoblast-mediated bone formation and enhanced accumulation of bone marrow fat. The PC1 C-ter-\nminal tail (PC1-CTT) binds to and facilitates TAZ nuclear translocation to co-activate Runx2-mediated osteoblas-\ntogenesis and co-repress PPAR\uf067-mediated adipogenesis in vitro. Computational approaches using structure-\nbased virtual screening discovered a novel agonist (mechanomimetic) that binds to the PC1:PC2 C-terminal tail\nhelix: helix interaction region and activates polycystins/TAZ signaling. These observations provide the scientific\npremise for the hypothesis that skeletal responses to loading are transduced by a mechanosensing complex in\nosteoblasts formed by interactions between PC1, PC2 and TAZ. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that Pkd1/TAZ have\ninterdependent functions in mature osteoblasts to regulate bone mass through the reciprocal stimulation of os-\nteoblastogenesis and inhibition of adipogenesis. In this aim, we will examine the effects of TAZ to differentially\nregulate osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo by creating mice with conditional knockout of\nTaz in mature osteoblasts (TazOc-cko). We will further test for genetic interactions between Taz and Pkd1 by\ncreating compound Pkd1Oc-cko/Taz Oc-cko mice. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the Pkd1/TAZ complex mediates\nthe response of osteoblasts to mechanical loading in vivo and in vitro using single and compound Pkd1 and Taz\nloss-of-function mouse models and osteoblast cultures. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that activation of the\nPC1/PC2/TAZ with a novel \u201cmechanomimetic\u201d will increase bone mass by stimulating osteoblastogenesis and\ninhibiting adipogenesis. Our impact will be to provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms medi-\nating the skeletal response to loading by validating the PC1/PC2/TAZ mechanosensing complex in osteoblasts.\nIn this new schema, PC1-CTT and TAZ form an integrative mechanosensing complex in cells within the osteo-\nblast lineage to differentially regulate Runx2-dependent osteoblastogenesis and PPAR\u03b3-mediated adipogenesis\nin response to physical cues in the bone microenvironment. The polycystins/TAZ complex is also a potential\ntherapeutic target for treating osteoporosis caused by skeletal unloading; and the newly discovered first-in-class\nmechanomimetic provides a chemical probe to test if targeting polycystins/TAZ results in increased bone mass.",

Despite these observations, little is known about the underlying mechanistic reasons at the cell and\ntissue level. To address this, we developed a high-throughput microphysiological engineered heart tissue (EHT)\nmodel of human cardiac tissue, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to study the effects\nof spaceflight on cardiac cell and tissue structure and function. These EHTs are generated with a biomimetic\nextracellular matrix composition and stiffness with increased tissue conductivity, which improves overall tissue\nunction and is more analogous to adult human myocardium than many previous models. During the first phase\nof the parental grant, these EHTs were launched to the International Space Station (ISS), where contractile\nforces were measured in real time using a magnet-based force sensor system. Following 28 days in microgravity,\ntissue contractile function was impaired and mitochondrial dysfunction was observed. During the UH3 phase, a\nrandom positioning machine is being used to simulate microgravity and to test attenuating strategies. In this\nproject, we will establish an in-house data management system to rigorously organize the datasets of the\nparental grant. These datasets will encompass control tissue function of physiologically-relevant tissues in our\nmicrophysiological system, tissues under real and simulated microgravity, and results of therapeutic screens on\ntissue function. It will also include information on strategies to prevent drug absorption in the polymeric\ncomponents of our system. Once organized, the data will be compatible with, and deposited into, the\nMicrophysiology Systems Database (MPS-Db), where it will be publicly available. Our data will expedite the\ndevelopment of technologies to combat the adverse cardiovascular effects caused by long-term exposure to\nmicrogravity. Additionally, the effects of spaceflight on the human body appear to mimic an accelerated aging\nprocess, including cardiac deterioration, in the general human population. We expect our data will also facilitate\nthe development of technologies and therapies to attenuate cardiomyopathies on Earth.",

                        "Project Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAging is associated with dysregulation of the immune response, which is also termed \u201cimmunosenescence.\u201d\nEach part of the immune system is influenced to some extent by the aging process. However, adaptive immunity\nseems more extensively affected, and it is especially the T cells that are altered. In fact, the number and\nproportion of late-differentiated T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, is higher in the elderly than in the young and\ntheir accumulation may contribute to the enhanced systemic pro-inflammatory milieu commonly seen in elderly\nindividuals. Interestingly, the proportion of CD8+ effector memory RA (TEMRA) cells increases significantly with\nage, which is not seen for CD4+ cells. We do not know exactly what causes these observed changes, but an\nunderstanding of the possible causes is now beginning to emerge. Spaceflight causes a suite of negative health\neffects that may be comparable to immunosenescence, which seems to be a key regulator of the regenerative\ncapacity of tissue- and organ-specific stem cells. Organ-specific stem and progenitor cells may allow the design\nof strategies for organ regeneration. The overarching objective of this proposal is to gain a better understanding\nof the influence of immunosenescence on the regenerative capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Specifically,\nstudies examining the effects of bone healing (by mesenchymal stromal cells) and vascular regeneration (by\nendothelial progenitor cells) are planned using tissue mimics on chip to represent \u201csemi-3D\u201d architectures.\nUltimately, we will use microgravity as an aging model, and we will translate those findings to improve human\nhealth on Earth by using tissue chips on the ISS for up to a month. Notably, the proposed studies investigate\npost-flight recovery of tissue chips using histological analysis combined with functional and genomic analysis. In\ncollaboration with Space Technology and Advanced Research Systems, Inc. - STaARS, well-versed in\nmaintenance of cell culture experiments in spaceflight, we are establishing an in vitro tissue-on-chip platform\nthat mimics human physiology to study the effect of immunosenescence on tissue-specific stem cells. This\nsystem will be designed for use in the UH3 phase in the extreme environment of space. In the UG3 phase, we\nwill examine the effect of simulated microgravity and normal (1xg) conditions on in vitro cultures of CD8+ T cells\nand on their co-culture with stem cells (UG3 Aim 1). In UG3 Aim 2 we will investigate the effect of microgravity\nat the International Space Station \u2013 National Lab (ISS-NL) on in vitro co-cultures of CD8+ T cells and stem cells.\nIn the UH3 phase, we will determine the effect of microgravity on immunosenescence (differentiation of CD8+ T\ncells into TEMRA cells) and tissue-specific stem cells in space as model for aging using microarrays (UH3 Aim 1).\nFinally, in UH3 Aim 2, we will investigate post-flight recovery of tissue chips (from Aim 1, UH3 phase) using\nfunctional analysis of stem cells. This proposal will contribute materially to our understanding of the impact of an\naged immune system on tissue healing and regeneration.",

                        "Project Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSpaceflight has been shown to have a negative impact on the heart and the cardiovascular system. As we plan\nfor exploration class missions that will see humans spend longer periods of time in space, such as in a manned\nmissions to Mars, the potential impact of spaceflight on the heart and cardiovascular system will likely be\nincreased. Additionally, the effects of spaceflight on the human body appear to mimic an accelerated aging\nprocess. Given that heart disease is the number one killer of all adults in the U.S., an understanding of the\ncardiogenic effects of microgravity may have implications for helping to treat millions of heart disease patients\non Earth. Unfortunately, much is still unknown regarding the effect of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system\nand the heart in particular. To address this issue, we will develop a high-throughput microphysiological model of\nhuman cardiac muscle, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), in order to study the effects\nof microgravity on cardiac tissue structure and physiological function. We will combine this cell source with a\ncardiac-specific decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based electroconductive composite scaffold to\npromote the maturation of cultured cells. The technologies developed during this study will facilitate the\ngeneration of mature 3D engineered cardiac tissues that recapitulate the microarchitecture and function of\nhuman myocardium. The data collected using this platform aboard the International Space Station (ISS) will\nprovide a better understanding of how prolonged microgravity affects the structure and function of the human\nheart. During the UG3 phase of this proposal, we will assess differences in cardiac function and physiological\nmaturation between cells maintained in normal gravity and microgravity environments. Engineered heart tissues\n(EHTs) made from hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes will be flown aboard the ISS for one month and be compared\nto identical ground controls. Real-time assessment of EHT contractility will be achieved via a novel\nmagnetometer-based motion sensor array, facilitating real-time and continuous assessment of function with\nminimal demands from the flight crew. Progressing to the UH3 phase, we will focus on the assessment of novel\ntherapeutic strategies with which to attenuate microgravity-induced cardiomyopathy. We will assess both drug\ncompounds and mechanical stimulation interventions and analyze each in isolation and in concert for their ability\nto improve cardiac function in space. The outcomes of this research could further improve our understanding of\nthe progression of chronic heart diseases on Earth, and help drive the development of new therapeutic strategies\nfor these debilitating conditions.",

Conventional two-\ndimensional (2-D) mammalian cell culture does not represent the physiological environments that form the basis\nfor normal cell function. A 3-D environment promotes isotropic cell-cell communications, provides extracellular\nguidance from structural matrix scaffolding, and allows spatiotemporal remodelling. Our specific interest is in\ninvestigating the effects of microgravity on heart function with the use of Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs). Since\nthese tissue engineering platforms support multicellular architecture from a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach, it is critical to\nunderstand the mechanisms of heart development from a primordial state. Although animal models are used\nwidely to investigate biological responses to therapeutics, inherent differences between human and animal\nbiology combined with the unlikelihood of animals developing a human disease limit the ability to validate\nresearch findings. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have emerged as an indispensable tool to\ndrive cells from an embryonic state to any somatic cell type. Our laboratory\u2019s focus and expertise in generating\nhiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and modelling of cardiomyopathies has yielded deeper insight into\nseveral rare and common causes of heart failure. To maintain a tissue-specific microenvironment, dissociated\ncells must be cultured in a physiologically relevant 3-D extracellular matrix (ECM). In the first phase (UG3), we\nwill generate hiPSC-CMs from healthy patients belonging to diverse racial groups (Caucasians, Hispanics, and\nAfrican Americans). The hiPSC-CMs will be used to fabricate our well-characterized EHT platforms, to\nunderstand cellular mechanisms that affect cardiac function both under microgravity and earth\u2019s gravity.\nAlterations in cardiac function due to weakened heart muscles in the samples exposed to microgravity will be\nmatched with molecular and electrophysiological disease patterns observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the\nsecond phase (UH3), the well-characterized microgravity-induced disease phenotype will be translated on Heart\nTissue Arrays (HTA) to screen for potential drug candidates in a high-throughput manner. The proposed study\nwill for the first time reveal key functional and molecular differences that drive phenotypic changes in heart tissues\non EHT assemblies under influence of microgravity.",

Astronauts\nsuffer from muscle degeneration after prolonged spaceflight. These effects are largely reversible; however, the\nintrinsic changes in skeletal muscle observed with age such as DNA damage, cellular stress, mitochondrial\ndysfunction and senescence are likely to overlap with cellular mechanisms induced in microgravity. Thus,\nstudies in microgravity using human tissue to model disease conditions may greatly contribute to development\nof clinically relevant approaches to address muscle wasting in the elderly referred to as sarcopenia. The\nnumber of elderly individuals over the age of 60 is growing at an unprecedented rate from ~11% of the global\npopulation today to ~21% by 2050. Therapeutic options to treat sarcopenia are relatively non-existent in part\nbecause of an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms controlling age-related skeletal muscle\ndysfunction. Our team has been focused on developing a millifluidic lab-on-a-chip system to study human\nskeletal muscle cell growth and gene expression changes in microgravity. We have established culture\nconditions for primary human myocytes isolated from young, healthy and older, sedentary volunteers and have\nbiological data indicating that the cells retain the phenotype of the donor tissue. Furthermore, we have\nfabricated a flight ready chip with multiple culture chambers. For this proposal, we plan to incorporate\nelectrodes into the chip and determine electric field strength distribution by simulation to optimize conditions for\nelectrically stimulating muscle myocytes embedded in a native mimicking extracellular matrix. Our lab-on-a-\nchip will be integrated into a remote controlled, fully automated laboratory solution complete with a fluid\nhandling system, an optical detection system to record contraction, and a software platform for near real-time\ncontrol of the experiment on the ISS housed in STaARS-1 experimental flight facility. On a subsequent flight,\nwe propose to test natural products with anti-atrophy properties in the validated lab-on-a-chip system. Drug\ndelivery to the muscle cultures will be facilitated via the addition of an administration port capable of delivering\nmultiple drug dilutions. Our next generation lab-on-a-chip system stands to be a leader in miniaturized lab\ndisease modeling to study pathophysiological changes in muscle tissue induced in microgravity intended to\nadvance drug efficacy and toxicological testing of therapeutics to elevate the burden of muscle wasting.",

                        "Project Abstract": "Abstract/ Project Summary\nThe increasing importance of technology in contemporary society necessitates a STEM literate population.\nThis represents a challenge for traditionally underrepresented populations (people of color, individuals with\ndisabilities, individuals in less affluent communities) impacting upward social mobility. Often, members of\nthese groups are doubly disadvantaged, as the few who become first generation college students often lack a\nroadmap for success through family, near peers and potential mentors. Success for this population,\nrepresenting a highly motivated group, needs to be nurtured to embrace and advance STEM disciplines,\nbefore they reach their college classrooms. This necessitates the education not only of students, but their\nteachers, providing synergies in teaching and learning to empower students to avail of opportunities perceived\nas being beyond their reach. We hypothesize that bridging this expanding gap requires an integrated program\nbringing together academic, social and real-world professional experiences to establish a pipeline linking\nsuccess in middle/high school to success for first generation college students and beyond. Such a pipeline will\ngenerate not only STEM-proficient citizens but also a cadre of near peers to motivate by example. With this\ncentral premise we have formed the STEM Through Authentic Research and Training (START) Program tot\nidentify recruit and retaining traditionally underrepresented populations by providing year-round authentic\nresearch opportunities and professional development for high school students (grades 9-12) and middle and\nsecondary STEM teachers (grades 5-12). START represents a partnership between the University of Kentucky\nproviding opportunities for STEM research, The Academies of Lexington, a partnership with the Fayette\nCounty Public Schools- focused on changing the traditional didactic model for STEM instruction, the KY-WV\nLSAMP program an NSF funded consortium led by UK including over 10 diverse academic institutions\nsupporting undergraduate research aimed at increasing the representation and overall success of traditionally\nunderrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. START establishes a natural pipeline to the collegiate\nlevel by virtue of the alliance with KY-WV LSAMP and its member institutions. Finally, we have recruited Space\nTango, a Lexington STEM start-up company which builds and integrates systems for scientific and biomedical\nresearch under microgravity conditions on the international space station. As such, a spectrum of research\nopportunities, from the molecular and microscopic level in participating UK STEM laboratories to the vastness\nof space itself afforded by Space Tango provide an exciting palate of opportunities for traditionally\nunderrepresented students and the teachers responsible for their STEM education. We believe that the\nintegration of real world authentic research opportunities in the context of overall STEM education via a unique\npartnership between academia, educational and commercial entities will motivate underrepresented student\npopulations to levels of achievement they often believe are beyond their horizons.",

                        "Project Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe development of low bone mass caused by aging, disuse due to paralysis, or extended space flights impacts\nmany individuals of all ages. Current therapeutics aim to slow the loss of bone mass, but none currently target the\nlack of mechanical loading that leads to declining bone mass in these situations. We have recently described a\nnovel pathway in vitro in which NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2) produces reactive oxygen species following the\nonset of fluid shear stress that, in turn, activates transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels to allow\nfor calcium influx. This ultimately results in calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) activation and\nsclerostin degradation, lifting the inhibition on osteoblasts to allow for bone formation. Though the mechano-\ntransduction cascade controlling sclerostin abundance has been described in in vitro osteocytes, the fidelity and\nimpact of this signaling pathway's impact on sclerostin regulation and bone mass has not been examined in vivo.\nThis proposal will examine how the loss of NOX2, a necessary early step in the mechano-transduction cascade,\naffects bone quality, both in unstimulated and mechanically-stimulated conditions, in an in vivo animal model.\nSupported by in vitro and in vivo preliminary data, we hypothesize that the mechano-transduction pathway\ncontrolling sclerostin in vitro is conserved in vivo and that disrupting NOX2-dependent ROS production will\naffect basal bone properties and impair bone acquisition in response to mechanical load. We will address this\nhypothesis in one aim with three independent experiments: (1) Examine how NOX2 deletion in osteocytes\nimpacts basal bone properties and mechano-responsiveness in vivo. Given the in vitro nature of our prior work on\nthis pathway, the contribution of this mechano-transduction pathway to in vivo bone mechano-responsiveness\nremained unresolved. To extend these in vitro findings, this proposal will use in vitro and in vivo models,\nspecifically a conditional deletion model, to address several knowledge gaps, including the cell autonomous role\nof NOX2 in osteocytes and the contribution of NOX2-mediated ROS to skeletal physiology and function. This\nproposal will validate novel therapeutic targets, such as ROS production, which can be exploited to mimic load\nin populations where traditional mechanical load is not possible.",

                        "Project Abstract": "Defective bone mechanosensing and skeletal unloading contribute to age-related and disuse osteoporosis. The\nmolecular mechanisms that transduce the osteoblast response to physical forces in the bone microenvironment\nto maintain skeletal homeostasis are poorly understood. We discovered a novel mechanosensing complex in\nosteoblasts created by an interaction between polycystins (PC1, Pkd1 and PC2, Pkd2) and TAZ (transcriptional\ncoactivator with PDZ-binding motif). The PC1/PC2/TAZ complex functions to sense and transduce mechanical\nloading into anabolic bone responses. Loss of either Pkd1 or Taz in mice results in osteopenia characterized by\na reciprocal decrease in osteoblast-mediated bone formation and an increase in adipocytes in bone marrow.\nCompound heterozygous mice lacking one copy of Pkd1 and TAZ exhibit additive decrements in bone mass,\nimpaired osteoblast-mediated bone formation and enhanced accumulation of bone marrow fat. The PC1 C-ter-\nminal tail (PC1-CTT) binds to and facilitates TAZ nuclear translocation to co-activate Runx2-mediated osteoblas-\ntogenesis and co-repress PPAR\uf067-mediated adipogenesis in vitro. Computational approaches using structure-\nbased virtual screening discovered a novel agonist (mechanomimetic) that binds to the PC1:PC2 C-terminal tail\nhelix: helix interaction region and activates polycystins/TAZ signaling. These observations provide the scientific\npremise for the hypothesis that skeletal responses to loading are transduced by a mechanosensing complex in\nosteoblasts formed by interactions between PC1, PC2 and TAZ. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that Pkd1/TAZ have\ninterdependent functions in mature osteoblasts to regulate bone mass through the reciprocal stimulation of os-\nteoblastogenesis and inhibition of adipogenesis. In this aim, we will examine the effects of TAZ to differentially\nregulate osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo by creating mice with conditional knockout of\nTaz in mature osteoblasts (TazOc-cko). We will further test for genetic interactions between Taz and Pkd1 by\ncreating compound Pkd1Oc-cko/Taz Oc-cko mice. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the Pkd1/TAZ complex mediates\nthe response of osteoblasts to mechanical loading in vivo and in vitro using single and compound Pkd1 and Taz\nloss-of-function mouse models and osteoblast cultures. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that activation of the\nPC1/PC2/TAZ with a novel \u201cmechanomimetic\u201d will increase bone mass by stimulating osteoblastogenesis and\ninhibiting adipogenesis. Our impact will be to provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms medi-\nating the skeletal response to loading by validating the PC1/PC2/TAZ mechanosensing complex in osteoblasts.\nIn this new schema, PC1-CTT and TAZ form an integrative mechanosensing complex in cells within the osteo-\nblast lineage to differentially regulate Runx2-dependent osteoblastogenesis and PPAR\u03b3-mediated adipogenesis\nin response to physical cues in the bone microenvironment. The polycystins/TAZ complex is also a potential\ntherapeutic target for treating osteoporosis caused by skeletal unloading; and the newly discovered first-in-class\nmechanomimetic provides a chemical probe to test if targeting polycystins/TAZ results in increased bone mass.",

                        "Project Abstract": "Summary: Respiratory diseases (RDs) are the fifth cause of death in the US and impose over $150B on\nhealthcare cost. RDs like asthma are incurable and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. As most\ndangerous RDs are progressive and manageable with preventive treatment, early detection is crucial to prevent\nexacerbation. Current diagnosis relies on costly and time-consuming clinical visits, discouraging preventative\nscreening without severe symptoms especially for low/middle-income population at higher RD risks due to more\nexposure to tobacco and work-related particulates. Diagnosis of RDs like asthma also relies on detection of\nintermittent abnormal respiratory sounds, which can benefit from prolonged recordings outside the clinic setting.\nIn this project, a low-cost, low-profile, easy-to-use and effective device will be developed to detect adventitial\nasthma respiratory sounds, facilitating access to screening and continuous treatment monitoring in RD patients.\n Auscultation is a powerful, non-invasive and well-established method to evaluate health of cardiopulmonary\nsystem through sounds of lung and heart. Stethoscopes have been used by physicians for over two centuries in\nclinics, but they are unsuitable for continuous cardiopulmonary activities monitoring due to large form-factor and\ndependence on listening skills and experience, prohibiting critical applications like ambulatory monitoring and\nearly detection of RDs in small children. A need exists for a low-profile, miniaturized, high-precision diagnostic\ndevice that is more accessible and can accurately detect and quantify respiratory abnormalities over prolonged\nmeasurements without relying on the skills and experience of a physician to interpret the sounds. To that end,\nthe electronic interface and acoustic coupling of a MEMS-based accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) onto\nskin will be optimized to record respiratory sounds with high fidelity, and compared against clinical diagnosis.\n Breakthrough, hermetically-sealed, high-precision ACMs with unidirectional vibration sensitivity will be used\nto overcome limits of standard stethoscopes that are bulky, susceptible to airborne and rubbing noise, and hard\nto use. Besides lung and heart sounds, the ACM simultaneously acquires respiratory rate, heart rate and physical\nactivities of the users. Data will be analyzed using simple algorithms like time-frequency analysis and continuous\nwavelet transformation to provide reliable information for diagnosis of asthma by detecting signature sounds like\nwheezing in a wide frequency range of 100Hz-5kHz. Diagnosis accuracy and comprehensiveness are expected\nto be improved by the ACM-enabled prolonged recording, capability of correlating respiratory sounds with heart\nsounds and body motions, and detection of higher frequency signals. Interface between ACM and skin will be\noptimized to increase acoustic coupling over a wide frequency range for wideband adventitious sounds. Low-\nprofile wearable ACMs will be used in a clinical setting to detect adventitial respiratory sounds indicative of\nasthma and compared with medical-grade digital stethoscopes and clinician judgment. Potentials of the ACM for\ndetecting information for other RDs like COPD and pneumonia will also be assessed for future developments.",
