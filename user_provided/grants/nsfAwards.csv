It is well appreciated that weight-bearing exercises are beneficial to the bones and lowers the risk of osteoporosis. In space, microgravity causes a number of physiological changes -- such as heart and bone deconditioning -- and represents a unique experimental environment to test biological hypotheses an environment that speeds up pathological changes. Despite a deep understanding of the outcomes of bone formation and bone loss in bone biomechanics, the mechanism of how applied loading affects the cells and causes bone loss and osteoporosis is not entirely clear. Recent research has suggested that a group of proteins, known as transcription factors, control gene expression in the nucleus of a cell and can be regulated by the stiffness of a cell. Leveraging the unique experimental environment on the International Space Station (ISS), this project will quantify the effect of microgravity on the stiffness of osteoblasts - bone forming cells - and relate this to the signaling that occurs due to key proteins.  In addition, the development and function of osteoblasts in microgravity will be compared with and without the addition of mechanical compression in order to see if this returns function to a normal state.  Answering these questions will support an increased understanding of how changes in bone loading cause bone loss and osteoporosis, which will in turn support improved prevention and treatment development.  The research results will be shared broadly with the public through public talks, seminars, and publications. The PI will collaborate with the Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program to develop a bioengineering module for the Saturday Series program for middle school students.  <br/><br/>This research combines microfluidic devices, cell biology, and bioengineered systems to test the hypothesis that cell mechanics regulates the crosstalk between YAP translocation and Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signaling in the context of osteoblast maturation.  The first objective will determine if microgravity affects osteoblast mechanosensitivity by reduceing cell tension and thereby regulationg YAP/BMP crosstalk.  The second objective will apply mechanical compression to osteoblasts to see if they recover their mechanosensitivity, as demonstrated by restored YAP/BMP signaling.  The project will implement a microfluidic device to autonomously measure the mechanical properties of cells under microgravity and compare these with measurements performed on Earth. The effect of cell tension on BMP signaling and YAP translocation will be measured both on Earth and at the ISS. The ability for mechanical compression to restore BMP signaling of osteoblasts in 3D spheroids under microgravity will also be examined. This work will deliver new bioengineering platforms that will extend current research abilities on the ISS. Significant insights will be gained at the nexus of cell tension, YAP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and BMP signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cartilage serves an important role in providing structural support and mechanical function throughout the body. Damage to cartilage causes pain and disability and lowers the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Once damaged, cartilage does not heal on its own. While some cartilage implants are already available, more progress must be made to create implants that replicate real cartilage structure and function, and that completely heal cartilage injuries. In this project, the key steps to creating cartilage implants will be studied in microgravity on the ISS to develop innovative engineering strategies that can be used on Earth. This project also includes the training of scientists from underrepresented backgrounds and the creation of outreach materials and activities to inspire grade-school students to be interested in tissue engineering in space.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to employ microgravity to enhance key steps in Earth-based cartilage tissue engineering. Current cartilage tissue engineering processes are limited by gravity and will therefore be investigated in the microgravity environment of the ISS.  The investigators will examine the redifferentiation of expanded chondrocytes via aggregate rejuvenation. Single cell RNA-sequencing with pathway analysis will be used to identify genes that are differentially expressed by both articular chondrocytes (ACs) and costal chondrocytes (CCs) after redifferentiation in microgravity versus on Earth, as well between the cell types in each gravity condition. Gene targets will be identified to inform the development of Earth-based strategies to enhance chondrocyte redifferentiation. In addition, scaffold-free self-assembled neocartilage comprised of ACs and CCs will be engineered in microgravity and on Earth. The differences in cellular spacing, gene expression, matrix content, and mechanical properties of neocartilage generated in each gravity condition will elucidate mechanisms of neocartilage formation and molecular targets for neocartilage stimulation. Finally, tension-stimulated neocartilage maturation in microgravity will be assessed to elucidate mechanotransduction pathways for generating mechanically robust neocartilage. Overall, this work will contribute to the development of biomimetic tissue-engineered cartilage implants that will benefit millions of people who suffer from cartilage afflictions and to the understanding of cartilage development. Additionally, the understanding of cell and cartilage function in microgravity that will be obtained may also help develop fitness regimens to maintain astronauts? cartilage health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each part of the immune system is influenced to some extent by the aging process. However, adaptive immunity, the immunity that allows us to eliminate disease producing agents (pathogens) or prevent their growth, seems more extensively affected.  As a result, there is increased susceptibility to infection, poor responses to vaccination, and increased incidence of autoreactivity (immune responses directed against the body's own tissues). It is not known exactly what causes these observed changes, but an understanding of the possible causes is now beginning to emerge. Many space-related physiological changes resemble those observed during aging. However, following microgravity exposure, such changes are more or less quickly restored after re-entry to Earth. This project aims to investigate the relationship between an individual's immune aging and healing outcomes, and to investigate the biology of aging from two directions--not only during its development in microgravity conditions but also during recovery. Designed to work like human organs, tissue chips mimic living human tissues and cells. The investigators will use a tissue chip design that enables them to explore the relationship between liver aging and regeneration and immune responses and to look for possible ways to slow the aging process and enhance the liver healing process. Each immune system chip includes two types of cells: a specific type of immune cell and liver cells, which interact with the immune cells. By sending the chips into space, the investigators will be able simulate the aging process of the immune system and understand how it affects our liver's ability to repair itself as we grow older. This research is expected to provide new insights into the molecular basis for many human conditions, which in this particular project relates to how microgravity induces aging of the immune system that may lead to the development of novel therapies here on Earth. In tandem with the scientific objectives, the project will work with the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkley to summarize how cell chips are plated and document each step of the space experience: from launch, to storage on the International Space Station (ISS), until sample return. The results and the concept of cellular engineering will be disseminated to a broad audience through a suite of new online resources.  The education goals include attracting students to the many STEM disciplines by engaging them with cutting-edge investigations on age-old, fascinating questions that include extending the human lifespan, and possible long-term human existence elsewhere beyond Earth and strengthening educators' and the public's support of this and other NSF-funded research by drawing in and connecting not only educators and students, but the general public to exciting medical research taking place aboard the ISS.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research thrust is to gain a better understanding of the influence of immunosenescence, the dysregulation of the body's immune response, which is associated with aging. Adaptive immunity seems particularly affected by the increase in the frequency of terminally differentiated CD8+ effector memory T (TEMRA) cells, which is driven by chronic antigen exposure and correlates with aging.  Many space-related physiological changes resemble those observed during aging but are restored after re-entry.  The investigators have already demonstrated that simulated microgravity induces the differentiation of T cells into TEMRA cells that impact the repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells and epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in wound healing and tube formation, respectively. The focus of this project is to gain a better understanding of the influence of immunosenescence on the regenerative capacity of liver-specific stem cells.  All experiments will utilize liver tissue mimics (in vitro 3D-co-cultures of CD8+ T cells and Liver Progenitor Cells (LPCs)) on tissue chips. Ultimately, the chips will be placed in the ISS for up to a month, where microgravity will serve as the aging model.  The Research Plan is organized under two objectives.  The First Objective is to study the effect of aged CD8+ T cells for liver progenitor cells behavior, plasticity, and repair capacity in space and to assess the relationship between an individual's immune reactivity and healing.  For these studies, after the month in space, the chips will be fixed/frozen for subsequent post-flight analysis.  The Second Objective is to investigate post-flight recovery of tissue chips using functional analysis.  For these studies, after the month in space, the chips will be returned live from space for post-flight analysis as the microgravity aged tissues recover. The combined objectives enable investigation of the biology of aging--not only its development but also its reversal. The data obtained are expected to provide important insights into the influence of T cell aging on liver stem cells and subsequent liver healing and regeneration that will lead to a new treatment paradigm for future use in patients with age-associated alteration in the liver. (Project integration and operation on the ISS will be provided by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) implementation partner, BioServe.)<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the incidence of sarcopenia is expected to rise in the elderly population, identifying cost-effective interventions that improve muscle formation and health is a major public health challenge.  Efforts to identify potential drugs have been hindered by sarcopenia's slow progression in clinical studies.  Microgravity is known to accelerate the process of aging and muscle disuse.  Therefore, by taking advantage of the microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station National Laboratory, it will be possible to develop a tissue engineered model of sarcopenia.  Once validated, this model can be used to study the progression of muscle deterioration and serve as a useful platform for testing potential treatments in a short period of time.  The overarching hypothesis is that engineered skeletal muscle in microgravity mimics relevant features of sarcopenia.  This platform has the potential to improve the quality of life of patients with sarcopenia or other muscle wasting diseases. In addition to the anticipated societal benefit of the research, the project includes educational outreach activities that have the goal of increasing the exposure and interest of Veteran college students from a Hispanic-serving local community college to pursue careers or majors in STEM areas.  These activities include teaching bioengineering concepts in a STEM seminar series; developing curriculum and teaching a bioengineering workshop; and offering science research internships in the laboratory of the principal investigator.  <br/><br/>This project proposes to design and characterize an in vitro engineered skeletal muscle platform in microgravity to model sarcopenia.  The model will be validated based on genomic and proteomic features, as well as by the remodeling of the extracellular matrix.  The first two aims involve developing the engineered muscle model on Earth and then taking advantage of a 7-day experiment on the International Space Station to induce the tissue changes seen in sarcopenia.  Once the sarcopenia model has been validated, it will be applied to demonstrate the feasibility of testing candidate drugs for treatment of sarcopenia. If successful, the proposed studies will significantly impact the pace of identifying drug candidates for effective treatment of sarcopenia, by serving as an important intermediate step prior to clinical trials.  In addition, the validated model will be a novel system to study the pathology of muscle degradation as a result of sarcopenia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, novel two-dimensional materials and polymer derived high temperature ceramics have captured the attention of the materials community. In this research project, two dimensional MXene will be incorporated into a silicon oxycarbide matrix to generate new materials, both on Earth and at the International Space Station. The high temperature evolution behaviors of two-dimensional materials and polymer to ceramic conversion under microgravity conditions will be systematically compared with the processes on Earth. These materials are expected to have high oxidation resistance, excellent electrical conductivity, and low density. They should also have great synergistic potentials for toughness, strength, and high temperature stability. The composites can be made into almost any shape (bulk, coating, discrete feature, et cetera) and size (nano- to macro-) based on application needs. In addition, these materials can easily produce complex shape, thin-wall, or freeform components with lightweight and functional capabilities in high temperature environments. This research will usher in a new generation of advanced materials which have great potential to be used  as heat exchangers, electric systems, catalyst support, energy storage, electrodes, nano-devices, and microsystems. Ultimately, project results will lead to new applications benefiting space science and life on Earth.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research project. The PI will expand current activities to Eastern Virginia while continuing efforts with different summer camps on campus. In addition, the PI will expand outreach efforts to the Western Virginia Science Museum to stimulate the interest of females and minorities in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This research project will advance understanding of atomic- and nano-level species interactions under different gravitational conditions in order to explore a new class of high temperature stable and electrically conductive materials. The high temperature composites will include both dense and porous microstructures but the methodology developed will be applicable to a wide range of high temperature materials derived from 2D additives and polymer precursors. This research project is expected to develop new theories, provide new knowledge, and offer novel methods in   atomic level design and thermodynamic prediction of polymer derived ceramics. Results from this project will open new opportunities for  using microgravity to understand and create novel high temperature materials. The team will conduct the research using four approaches. First, using MXene exfoliation and surface functionalization, pre-pyrolysis at 500-700�C will be conducted in order to provide controlled states for microgravity and Earth gravity studies. Second, different atmosphere pyrolysis will be conducted on Earth and under microgravity to understand the atmosphere and gas release effects on new phase formation. Third, theoretical thermodynamic calculation and experimental pyrolysis studies will be combined in order to explore the fundamental interfacial interaction and phase evolution processes. Finally, gravitational effects on 2D MXene deformation, stacking, and chemical interaction with silicon oxycarbide during pyrolysis will be comprehensively investigated; the phase and structural evolution of the porous systems will be correlated with pore stability and shrinkage/collapse under different gravity conditions. The educational component is training of multiple graduate and undergraduate students, with a focus on women and minorities. The PI will expand current activities to Eastern Virginia while continuing efforts with different summer camps on campus. In addition, the PI will expand outreach efforts to the Western Virginia Science Museum to stimulate the interest of females and minorities in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

End-stage organ failure affects millions of people.  The current treatment is organ transplantation, which is severely limited by a shortage of donor organs.  Scientists have been trying to tissue-engineer organs outside of the body that can be used as replacements for failing organs, but these efforts have been challenged by the difficulty of creating networks of small blood vessels that can perfuse large pieces of tissue.  Studies have shown that when cells are given the freedom to organize and assemble themselves in low-gravity conditions called microgravity, they establish important cell-cell relationships and can form tissue structures such as capillary tubes.   In this research, using the liver as a model organ, the research team will investigate how microgravity conditions onboard the International Space Station may be used to facilitate development of a large, vascularized tissue graft.  The researchers hypothesize that a combination of factors, including the microgravity environment unique to the International Space Station, will produce a functional and vascularized liver tissue. The research results will include a time-lapse video of how the different cell types organize themselves in response to a growth factor gradient in microgravity.  This will allow investigators to better understand how microgravity regulates tissue formation.  In addition to the scientific objectives, the research team will raise public awareness of the potential benefits of biomedical research in space through efforts in K-12 education, mentoring groups underrepresented in S.T.E.M., public outreach, and industry partnership.<br/><br/>This project centers around two research goals. First, the microgravity environment of the ISS will be used to cerate a macroscopic, vascularized liver tissue.  The researchers hypothesize that the combination of an environment of 3D spatial freedom, a perfusion force within a central conduit that does not have to compete with the gravitational force, and sustained, directional angiogenic gradient will support the development of a functional, vascularized liver graft.  The liver organoids will be developed by co-culturing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocytes with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).  The organoids will then be loaded into tissue culture vessels with a hollow fiber conduit to support the flow of blood and bile.  The physiological response of the tissue graft will be assessed to validate the model through both laboratory assays and xenotransplantation.  The second goal is to characterize the effect of microgravity and directional angiogenic gradients on 3D intercellular interactions and microvascular organization.  By using live-cell, time-lapse confocal microscopy, the effect of these environmental factors on the co-cultured cells of the organoids will be examined.  This portion of the project will advance fundamental understanding of how cells respond to a microgravity environment with respect to tissue self-assembly, which will support future work to advance the engineering of 3-dimensional tissue constructs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increased cardiovascular cell and tissue stiffness is a characteristic associated with normal aging as well as a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, astronauts exposed to microgravity also experience aortic stiffening and reduced cardiac function. Thus, understanding the process and cardiac consequences of arterial stiffening in microgravity may provide new insights into the related cardiovascular diseases associated with aging on Earth.  This may then lead to new ways to improve cardiovascular health for humans on Earth as well as for astronauts in microgravity. The overall objective of this research project is to utilize organ-on-chip technology to study accelerated cardiovascular aging in microgravity. The researchers will deploy a novel, organ-on-chip model, known as a micro-CVchips, of the human cardiovascular system in which cardiac and arterial structures will be grown from human pluripotent stem cells and linked in a functional, miniature circulatory system. This will allow for the modeling of fluid movement and organoid stiffness in addition to cell and tissue physiology. A set of these micro-CVchips will be sent to the International Space Station (ISS) to experience microgravity, where they will be monitored and manipulated within a robotic laboratory to determine any signs of an accelerated aging process. Finally, the micro-CVchips will be retrieved and examined on Earth with a set of thorough biological tests. These chips will be compared to control chips that remained on Earth, in addition to patient samples obtained from a tissue biobank at Mount Sinai. This project will also be used as a vehicle to teach and inspire local high school students as part of an ongoing collaboration between Mount Sinai and several New York City schools. <br/><br/>This project is supported by 3 scientific objectives.  First, a multi-tissue in vitro microfluidic human organoid model of the cardiovascular system will be characterized.  This microfluidic system includes separate cardiac and arterial organoid compartments linked in an endothelialized circulatory system.  It will be capable of autonomous cardiac driven flow and arterial driven fluidic resistance changes, allowing it to model arterial stiffening and associated cardiac diastolic dysfunction.  Second, a set of the micro-CVchips will be sent to the ISS to experience extended microgravity.  Tests for phenotype markers of arterial stiffening and diastolic cardiac dysfunction will be made on board the ISS using an innovative robotic pressure control and video system for near-real-time terrestrial monitoring.  This will be combined with post-flight histology studies.  Finally, the post-flight analysis of the samples returned from the ISS will be compared to control samples maintained on Earth through numerous molecular biology techniques in order to identify novel disease biomarkers and pathways.  The data from the micro-CVchip will also be compared to data obtained from patient samples obtained through the Mount Sinai Cardiovascular Biorepository and 'Omics Facility in order to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the new in vitro model of cardiovascular aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In microgravity, the similar absence of biomechanical loading caused likely also damages cartilage tissue and cells. In this work, we will develop an engineered cartilage tissue construct to overcome the presumed degradation of cartilage in microgravity. This work will benefit life on Earth by improving our understanding of the effects of microgravity on cartilage.  The results of this work may lead to new therapies to treat cartilage injuries.  The results of this work will also benefit astronauts? health when they return to Earth. Furthermore, outcomes of this study will be used to introduce undergraduate and graduate engineering students to tissue engineering and nanomedicine. In addition, this work will increase diversity among biomedical engineers by encouraging underrepresented students to engage in science and engineering.  Additional outreach activities are planned for middle/high school students and the general public. <br/><br/>Mechanical stimulation is critical to maintain chondrogenesis (differentiation into cartilage) and cartilage homeostasis (health maintenance); an absence of biomechanical loading results in degradation of articular cartilage. Because natural cartilage has limited self-repair ability, it is a significant challenge to regenerate authentic cartilage tissue after it degenerates. On Earth, prolonged joint immobilization can cause catabolic (breakdown) activities of chondrocyte and subsequent cartilage degradation. In space, the absence of biomechanical loading caused by microgravity most likely also damages chondrocyte function and cartilage homeostasis. If we can engineer a cartilage tissue construct to overcome the presumed degradation of cartilage in microgravity, it should also improve tissue engineering research and healthcare on Earth. This work will create a construct which can automatically supply itself with mechano-responsive microRNA as a therapy to restore cartilage cell chondrogenesis. The result will be a long-lasting (homeostatic) cartilage tissue construct to maintain cartilage cell chondrogenesis and homeostasis in the long term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exposure to spaceflight or reduced mechanical loading on Earth induces marked bone loss, muscle atrophy, and degradation of soft tissues. Despite advances in exercise and pharmacologic countermeasures designed to reduce musculoskeletal deterioration on Earth and in spaceflight, the protection is incomplete and response to these interventions are variable. Many studies have focused on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie atrophy and subsequent recovery.  However, little attention has been given to the extracellular matrix (ECM), the material in which cells reside. The ECM is a complex network that varies in composition between specific tissues depending on the mechanical and functional demands. Changes to the ECM can permanently alter tissue material properties, prevent resident cells from re-establishing homeostasis, and affect functionality. There is a need to better understand the fundamental changes that occur in ECM composition due to microgravity that compromise tissue functionality.<br/><br/>In this study, temporal changes in ECM proteins in response to, and after recovery from, microgravity will be investigated to test the following hypothesis: disuse of the musculoskeletal system irreversibly affects the ECM by reducing protein turnover and increasing enzymatic and non-enzymatic cross-links, leading to the incomplete restoration of functionality after a return to 1g. Unlike gene expression that significantly varies within minutes, a common measure to assess for the physiological effects of microgravity, the proteome changes over hours to days, and provides a more stable indicator of physiology that can withstand reentry, landing, and transport of mice from the ISS. Metabolic labeling and proteomic methods will be combined to track ECM turnover in vivo by providing mice with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that are incorporated into proteins using endogenous cellular machinery. ncAAs possess bioorthogonal handles that enable the enrichment of newly synthesized proteins through click reactions with complementary chemical groups. The murine proteome will be labeled with ncAAs at different timepoints after the onset of microgravity to provide a robust ?time-stamp? of proteins formed in all tissues in the body in response to unloading. The study will first identify the optimal parameters to label newly synthesized ECM proteins on Earth and the ISS, then test response of the musculoskeletal ECM to two different unloading paradigms: hindlimb suspension on Earth and spaceflight on the International Space Station. Concomitant study of three musculoskeletal tissues: bone, tendon, and skeletal muscle, and the use of mass spectrometry, will reveal biomarkers and pathways that are important to disuse atrophy and subsequently recovery across musculoskeletal tissues. In addition, the study will provide an unprecedented resource for CASIS to disseminate ncAA-labeled tissues through established tissue-sharing mechanisms that will benefit a wide range of secondary science investigators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As people age, they heal less efficiently in response to inflammation and injury. There is evidence that changes within fibroblasts, the cells responsible for production of extracellular matrix, play a significant role in alterations to healing response. In this project, a team from Tufts University will assess the impact of cellular age and the age of the extracellular matrix on models of wound healing. The unique environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) will be leveraged to simulate processes associated with ageing. The outcomes of this project will serve the national interest by training the next generation of scientists, encouraging students at the middle and high school levels to pursue careers in research, and by advancing health via a more fundamental understanding of wound healing with age.<br/><br/>The project plans to explore how changes associated with ageing of the extracellular matrix and fibroblasts, and their interaction, influence tissue dysfunction and impaired healing with age and exposure to microgravity. While previous work has assessed the effects of microgravity on fibroblasts and wound healing, there has been no attempt to evaluate this impact in the context of developmental age, even though healing effectiveness varies significantly with age. Two specific research objectives are pursued. First, the investigators will determine the effects of microgravity on fibroblast phenotype as a function of tissue type and developmental age.  Second, the impacts of simulated aging via microgravity exposure aboard the ISS on wound healing response in ontogenetic mimics of tissue stroma will be investigated. A novel silk-extracellular matrix hydrogel system will be deployed to decouple cellular and extracellular contributions to this process for the first time. These studies will elucidate the mechanisms of altered wound healing associated with microgravity and inform our understanding of how ageing impacts these same phenomena on Earth. This knowledge could lead to new treatments to promote better wound healing and restore tissue function throughout the body.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two liquid phases are separated by soft interfaces that are greatly affected by gravitational forces and are easily deformed either by thermal fluctuation or by external flows. Everyday experience demonstrates how gentle shaking induces waves of a soft interface, while more rigorous shaking reinitializes the phase separation dynamics. Active matter provides an alternative method of generating fluid flows through the collective motion of microscopic energy-consuming constituents. It remains an open question of how active matter-based internally-generated flows couple to the soft interfaces and the associated liquid-liquid phase separation. Ground-based research indicates intriguing behaviors, but gravitational forces suppress large-scale deformation and full exploration of the possible behaviors. This project is focused on developing a quantitative understanding of the active interfaces. From a broader perspective, this project will train undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, and provide support for developing a curriculum-enriching Saturday course for high school students that is centered around the topic of soft materials, liquid-liquid phase separation, and microgravity research.<br/><br/>The research goals of this project are divided into three complementary aims, which will greatly increase understanding of active liquid-liquid phase separation and associated active interfaces. In the first aim, millimeter-sized soft interfaces will be created that separate a bulk active fluid from a passive polymer suspension. The research will determine how gravity influences active fluctuations and associated traveling waves, which are visible by the naked eye. The project will also study how a macroscopic interface disintegrates to generate an active emulsion, a transition that is suppressed by gravity but should be observable in a microgravity environment. In the second aim, the project will start with a uniform initial state and study the dynamics of coarsening active droplets. Microgravity will render our samples truly two-dimensional. Finally, in the third aim, gravity affects will be studied to determine how the active wetting transition that occurs when active fluid climbs along a boundary. The acquired data will rigorously test theoretical models of how active stresses couple to soft deformable surfaces. Such models are essential for building synthetic mechanical protocells and might have relevance to our understanding of biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many of these products and processes, microstructure and stabilization of foams and emulsions play critical roles in determining their properties and performance.

The project aims to answer these questions by imaging foams and emulsions at high resolution in microgravity environment in which gravity-induced influencing factors can be eliminated. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand (a) the packing structure of monodisperse foams and emulsions close to the dry limit with zero-fraction of continuous phase and (b) the impact of using colloidal particles instead of surfactant on microstructure and stabilization of foams and emulsions.

Proposed microgravity experiments include microfluidic generation of monodisperse bubbles and drops, collection of foams and emulsions, and microscopy imaging of foam/emulsion samples. The resultant microscopy images to be collected on ISS will then be analyzed and interpreted using Imaris, ImageJ, in-house Matlab program, and Surface Evolver program.

Age and reduced physical activity disrupt mechanical signaling and diminish the potency of stem cells within the bone marrow that replenish bone-building cells. Even though poor skeletal health is a major cause of injury and disability among aged individuals, the reason for reduced bone-building responsiveness to exercise in older individuals, compared to younger individuals, remains a knowledge gap. This project will quantify the mechanical forces that cells are subjected to in bone by using novel 3D printed tissue engineering constructs. Combining this technology with the aging conditions caused by microgravity in experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station will reveal the putative connections between aging and physical activity at the cellular level. Ultimately, these efforts may lead to non-pharmacologic, regenerative strategies to improve muscle and bone health in in older adults, in those who must undergo extended bedrest, and astronauts. The multidisciplinary approach taken in this bioengineering project will be an excellent platform to fascinate and engage the next generation of students and young scientists.<br/><br/>A major technical barrier in studying the mechanical environment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside within bone marrow is that there are no model systems currently available that can replicate the mechanical complexity of the bone marrow compartment. To close this gap, this work will develop a 3D printed bone marrow analog system that combines an in vivo environment with the accessibility of an in vitro culture system. This will permit a systematic approach of study. To study cellular mechanical environments within these marrow analogs, the approach will include an experimental setup and a complementary and validated finite element model. These mechanoactive marrow environments will provide a novel tool for mechanobiologists to systematically study the effect of the mechanical environment on cell responses in 3D. Utilization of this novel system in this project will specifically advance mechanobiology knowledge by: (1) quantifying the mechanoresponse of old MSCs in a young bone marrow geometry and vice versa, thereby identifying the contribution of mechanical stress environment to the mechanosignaling capacity of aged MSCs. (2) establishing, for the first time, how the mechanical stress environment contributes to microgravity-simulated aging of MSCs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project examines how gravity-controlled melt flow can be used to engineer uniformly distributed rare earth ions into crystals, which is critical in order to unlock the potential of these materials. Understanding how the dynamics of crystal formation under microgravity lead to stable formations provides foundational knowledge for future materials engineering research. This project is complimented by an outreach and education program that integrates high-temperature crystal growth under microgravity with new, hands-on curricula to engage underrepresented groups in science and engineering and encourage the next generation of research professionals. <br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Summary<br/>This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, addresses the need for novel routes for synthesis of unconventional materials. It aims to enable the full scientific potential of single-phase multicomponent equiatomic rare earth oxides as a new class of functional materials. These oxides have not been explored nearly as extensively as high-entropy metallic alloys and until now have existed only as polycrystalline ceramics. A revolutionary method, micro-pulling-down technique, is used for the first time to demonstrate crystal growth and investigate mechanisms that govern gravity-controlled melt convection during directional crystallization of such complex systems. The project exploits the interplay between the convective and diffusive melt flow patterns in order to enhance melt mixing near the growth interface and achieve stable growth conditions. As a result, phase stability and homogeneous cation distribution in the grown crystals leads to novel phenomena and properties for applications in clean energy, lighting, medical, national security and fundamental physics research that may surpass functionality of traditional one-component compounds. A large number of possible combinations opens a pathway to compositional feasibility of a large number of complex systems. Additionally, the micro-pulling-down method as a tool for materials discovery and synthesis is introduced to the US academic community for both research and education through this research project. Availability of modern crystal growth techniques improves the national competitiveness in materials research and provide opportunities for educating and training future crystal growth scientists.

The boiling heat transfer performance is directly related to the removal rate of bubbles generated during boiling. However, in most terrestrial applications, bubble departure is naturally driven by buoyancy; it is difficult to control the bubble departure size and frequency. A simple method that can actively control bubble motion with large tuning range is highly desirable, since it would significantly expand the range of achievable boiling heat transfer rate, with the potential to improve the efficiency of power plants and reduce energy consumption in building thermal management. This project aims to develop a new method to control bubbles and droplets, by exploiting liquids whose surface tension can be changed with light. The microgravity environment eliminates the interference of buoyancy, which allows us to purely observe and understand this light-driven fluid motion. This method can be generalized to manipulate multi-phase fluid for condensation processes and applications including precision control in 3D printing, lab-on-a-chip microfluidics for biomedical and optical applications. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to achieve dynamic manipulation of multi-phase fluid motion using light and photo-responsive surfactants, and apply it to enhance boiling heat transfer. Photo-responsive surfactants can reversibly switch their molecular conformation when illuminated with light, resulting in a dynamically tunable and spatially reconfigurable surface tension that can drive multi-phase fluid motion (the photo-Marangoni effect). The project tasks include: (i) experimentally test the depinning criteria and migration velocity of droplets and bubbles controlled by light, (ii) develop the first modeling framework for the photo-Marangoni effect, and ultimately (iii) promote bubble departures during boiling to enhance thermal transport by optically ?pinching off? bubbles with control. The use of microgravity is essential to enable large length scales exceeding the typical capillary lengths on earth, as well as long time scales for bubble/droplet departure, which greatly reduces the requirements of microscopic and high-speed visualization. Microgravity will also allow direct experimental observation of the proposed light-controlled motion without buoyancy and natural convection, which ensures accurate fundamental understanding and comparison to theory. This light-tuning method will serve as an effective yet simple new platform for dynamic fluid and heat transfer manipulation. This platform will significantly contribute to developing new research capabilities and inspiring new applications beyond heat transfer, such as novel approaches to droplet-based biochemical assays, dynamic patterning and manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists have also used these cells to study heart disease and drug responses. Currently, when scientists grow cardiac muscle cells in a dish, the characteristics of these cells look like the heart cells at the early developmental stage; their shape, size, and function resemble immature heart cells. Ideally, more mature cardiac muscle cells are needed in cardiac cell replacement therapy and the study of heart disease. Therefore, developing methods to accelerate the maturation of cardiac muscle cells is highly significant. The unique environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is known to provide beneficial effects on human cardiac precursors to help their growth and differentiation. In this project, the research team will investigate the maturation of stem cell-derived cardiac muscle cells by growing these cells in tissue-like structures in the ISS. The investigators also plan to develop a technology to promote cardiac muscle cell maturation in microtissues that are suitable for large-scale production, a requirement essential for translational research.  This project also incorporates the training of young scientists and students and provides science-learning opportunities for kids in a local hospital in the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta system.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to establish a multipronged approach combining microgravity, tissue engineering and metabolic regulation to promote the maturation of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). First, the investigators will optimize the design of tissue engineering and cell culture conditions in ground-based experiments by examining the effect of simulated microgravity, cell composition and metabolic regulation. Second, the hiPSC-CM microtissues will be cultured in the ISS. The experiments will be performed within a perfusion system that is suitable for suspension cell culture and has gas permeable membranes that allow sufficient gas exchange for cell growth. The cells will remain in the same culture units throughout the experiment and cell morphology will be monitored once a week utilizing an inverted phasecontrast microscope currently available at the ISS, and the imaging data will be transmitted for ground-based control and data retrieval.  Following spaceflight, the researchers will investigate molecular and functional characteristics of the hiPSC-CMs. Exposure of hiPSC-CM microtissues to microgravity in space is expected to eliminate shear stress and consequently enhance cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions within multicellular architectures. Findings from this project will provide insights into the molecular regulation of accelerated hiPSC-CM maturation.  Applying these insights to the research on earth could assist in the production of more mature hiPSC-CMs to enhance their potential application in regenerative medicine, the study of heart disease and drug development.

However, when powders and grains are electrically charged, they stick to surfaces and collect into aggregates.  This leads to severe industrial problems, for example, producing large variations in the active ingredient concentration in pharmaceuticals.  Likewise, sticking of thick, tenacious layers of polymers within processing equipment can force manufacturers to shut down operations and jack-hammer the stuck layers from the equipment walls.  On the positive side, some technologies such as electrospraying and photocopying rely on the sticking of charged particles.  Despite the profound problems and significant opportunities associated with granular charging and sticking, the topic is remarkably poorly understood.  In previous work, the principal investigator has shown that particle aggregates are affected by patterns of charge, rather than total charge, on granular surfaces.  The research in this award will develop new methods to measure charge patterns that correlate to sticking behaviors.  The research team will perform both computer simulations and laboratory tests to confirm the connection between these new measurements and the formation of electrostatic sticking behaviors.  New methods to control sticking in industrial operations will also be investigated.<br/><br/><br/>The research will consist of three specific aims.  First, investigators will develop and validate a method of measuring dipole moments of free particles in microgravity experiments designed to evaluate electrostatic aggregation of free particles in vacuum and under microgravity -- i.e. under nearly ideal conditions.  These experiments are being performed by collaborators through separate funding.  Second, the experiments produce aggregates of 50 micron particles whose individual charges can be individually evaluated: the principal investigator and his team will use this information as input to simulations of forces acting on the aggregates to establish the magnitudes of net charge and dipole moments on each particle required to hold the aggregates together.  The outcome at this point will be direct, computer-guided experimental evaluations of relative strengths of dipole and net charge influences on aggregate cohesion.  Third, the researchers will perform independent experiments to evaluate the net charge and dipole moment on individual particles involved in controlled collisions.  This will permit them to both establish how large dipole components are likely to become as a result of collisional dynamics, and to determine whether these magnitudes agree with the microgravity experiments.  Having completed these aims, the investigators will for the first time have access to experimentally validated methods for obtaining dipole moments of free particles.  The researchers will have applied the methods to the description of purely electrostatic forces acting both on aggregates (""aggregation""), and between aggregates and surfaces (""sticking"").

This instability is manifested by the sudden generation of waves and fluid motion at the interface and is termed the Faraday instability. The effect of gravity on vibration-induced instability at the interface between liquid bilayers will be investigated. Experiments performed on the International Space Station will test theories about the onset of the Faraday instability and its associated flow patterns. This study will be the first attempt to utilize the unique environment of microgravity to obtain information on the Faraday instability problem.  Addressing this question could impact important processes here on Earth, including microfluidic mixing in bio-separations, microscale heat transfer, additive manufacturing, atomization-fuel injection, and patterned substrate development. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students working with space-implementation partner engineers. The project also involves both high school and middle school students from rural schools through summer science programs, in-class demonstrations, hands-on experiments, and live displays of microgravity experiments.<br/><br/>The Faraday instability arises from resonance between the applied frequency of shaking and the natural frequency of a liquid system with an interface. The morphological patterns of the interface are dominated by gravity and insensitive to interfacial tension. It is hypothesized that, when gravity is absent, the length scales of the instability are much smaller than under Earth?s gravity bringing out the dominant effect of interfacial tension. This, in turn, ought to cause the interface to rupture in the absence of gravity for small frequencies, but not for high frequencies. This research project seeks to validate models for Faraday instability with defining experiments conducted in the absence of gravity on the International Space Station, comparing these to ground experiments. The project also seeks to determine when the interface saturates to standing waves and when it breaks catastrophically to rupture. Experiments involve direct imaging under frequency and amplitude control while the theory involves Floquet and nonlinear analyses that employ high fidelity spectral methods. Validation of models by irrefutable evidence gathered under a well-controlled, unique microgravity environment have the potential to be translatable to other important fields such as acoustic, electrostatic, and magnetic levitation and forcing of fluid interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of its importance and ubiquitousness, turbulent transport of particles has been widely investigated. However, numerous questions remain which limit a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon and modeling capacities. For instance, it is still unclear whether small spherical particles in a turbulent environment settle slower, faster, or at the same speed than in a quiescent (no flow) fluid. Development of predictive models relies on generating refined experimental and numerical data to accurately characterize the subtle multi-scale physical mechanisms at play. This award aims at exploring particle-turbulence interactions in low-gravity conditions with the goal of separating gravitational and inertial forces to better understand and implement their influence in inertial particle models. Broader impacts are tailored to the participating students and researchers as well as the broader public.<br/><br/>Utilizing the Dryden Drop Tower, a unique facility located at PSU, this award will perform a systematic experimental exploration of the single and collective particle interactions with turbulence in microgravity conditions. Microgravity experiments will provide the opportunity to explore the effects purely attributable to inertia. These will be systematically surveyed by considering particles with various response times (tunable by change in material and/or particle size). The objectives of the proposed investigation include: 1) dissociating the effects of particle inertia and gravity on particle-turbulence interactions for both finite-size and punctual single particles, 2) evaluating joint effects promoted by clustering and/or particle-particle interactions of finite size and point-particles in a turbulent flow under microgravity, and 3) developing Lagrangian stochastic models for finite size particles in gravity. Broader impact activities include STEM training at the post-graduate, graduate, and undergraduate level and international research visits.

At the same time these fires contribute to air pollution over much larger geographical areas. This proposal seeks to reduce the severity and impact of these fires by improving the ability to predict their spread and growth. Wildland fires are very dynamic with rapidly changing winds and fuel loads yet much research to date is based on steady analysis. Recent research has provided a more complete understanding of fire growth, particularly the role of intermittent fuel heating from the flame, but overall, there is an absence of fundamental research on non-steady (periodic or intermittent) flame spread. The objective of this project is to study a spreading flame?s response to a non-steady forced flow to better predict wildfire spread. This will be accomplished through terrestrial experiments under mixed convection flow (buoyant and forced flow) as well as microgravity experiments with purely forced flow. These experiments will characterize and help explain transient flame behavior under non-steady flow conditions. This knowledge will provide the research community with insight into the role of non-steady flow processes in wildfire spread.  <br/><br/>This project will examine the physical mechanisms by which transient flame behavior impacts a spreading flame with a non-steady concurrent airflow using experiments and computational modelling. The goal of this project is to better predict wildfire spread by examining the role of intermittent fuel-heating from flames on the rate of fire spread. Recent research has found that intermittent flame heating processes can be the dominant heat transfer process under certain fire conditions, resulting in fire spread that is not predicted by current models. Thus, there is a need to develop a ?verifiable physical theory? of wildfire spread. This project seeks to contribute towards the goal of developing such a theory by studying the related fundamental problem of flame spread aided by non-steady airflow. Here it is proposed to use a non-steady (periodic) external forced flow to experimentally simulate the intermittent flow induced by the buoyant instabilities and/or a turbulent boundary layer. Inclusion of microgravity experiments will enable removal of buoyancy effects and better characterization the non-steady flow. The proposed research will be one of the first, if not the first, experimental study specifically investigating the response of spreading flames to a non-steady, concurrent airflow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this grant will support work to better understand how proteins respond to mechanical forces.  Organisms are continuously sensing mechanical forces and respond appropriately.  For example, the Earth?s gravity is constantly pulling down and the atmospheric pressure which compresses from all directions, yet organisms can remain upright. If the ability to sense these physical effects is compromised, it can lead to developmental disorders, muscle and bone loss, neurological abnormalities, immunological, and age-related problems.  These conditions have been observed even in astronauts, who are exposed to microgravity during prolonged times away from Earth.  The work done under this grant use novel microtechnology systems that mimic different physical environments.  These microtechnology systems will be used to investigate how mechanical changes in the physical environment differentially affect thousands of proteins.  Characterizing these biological responses will ultimately lead to improvements in national health. For example, the results of this work may ultimately inform future therapeutic strategies or disease prevention techniques. This project will also create an educational and training program for interdisciplinary collaboration.  Engineers and biological scientists will work together, and participation in research for underrepresented groups will be broadened. <br/><br/>Different types of Earth?s physical forces continuously impact living beings as a part of their ceaseless adaptation to external stimuli. While much is known about mechanotransduction in specific sensory systems, little is known about generalized mechanosensation of the surrounding physical environment by whole organisms. One reason for this lack of knowledge is the limited methods to mechanically stimulate enough whole organisms to enable comprehensive proteomic analysis. To investigate generalized mechanosensation, hundreds of living Drosophila embryos will be exposed to multiple modes, amplitudes, and durations of various mechanical stimulation such as microgravity, hypergravity, and external compression using microfabricated high-throughput devices that will be developed. This work will utilize the comparative proteomics approach of 2D-DIGE (2 Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis) to identify changes in protein abundance or post-translational regulation in response to these different modes of mechanical stimulation. This approach will also enable the proteomic comparison of local/acute to chronic/ubiquitous mechanical stimulation.

These particles generally move from hot to cold regions.  This phenomenon, which is known as thermophoresis, affects a wide variety of processes, such as drug delivery and bioseparations utilized for detecting viruses.  However, the current understanding of thermophoresis is limited.  Experimental studies have conflicting evidence, making it difficult to determine the fundamental mechanisms that drive particle motion.  Very few studies have considered the motion of these particles in more complex fluids and gels. The challenge in interpreting experimental data is that it is difficult to separate effects of thermophoresis from effects of fluid flow arising from variations in the fluid density owing to variations in temperature. To overcome this limitation, this NSF-CASIS project will pair terrestrial experiments with those in microgravity onboard the International Space Station (ISS) where buoyancy-driven fluid flow is negligible.  The goals are to determine the fundamental physics and chemistry driving thermophoresis in simple and complex fluids and to use this information for enhancing viral separation platforms by optimizing fluid properties. In an era when disease control affects everyone, this project will focus on developing enhanced and robust microfluidic viral-load detection devices.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to measure the thermophoretic motion of particles in complex fluids on the ISS to aid in the design of next-generation bioseparations devices for label-free viral load detection. Gravity-driven buoyancy-induced recirculation due to thermal expansion of the fluid is inhibited in microgravity, which will enable unambiguous measurements of thermophoresis. The project will use multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT) to simultaneously obtain local thermophoretic and rheological data. Fluids will range from variable ionic strength Newtonian liquids to non-Newtonian fluids with varying degrees of linear viscoelasticity or a temperature dependent sol-gel transition. The size and surface properties of probe particles will be changed and will span properties of biologically relevant nanoparticles, such as viruses.  Terrestrial experiments will focus on fluid property selection through rheological testing, particle synthesis, and downstream redesign of microfluidic platforms utilizing complex fluids to enhance bioseparations.  The team will design these experiments with Tec Masters, Inc. to create a module that remotely performs all operations of sample manipulation, precision heating, high-speed/high-magnification imaging, and data transfer on the ISS.  This basic research and first demonstration of the utility of microrheology in space will impact the rheology, colloid and interfacial science, and bioseparation communities and train postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers.

These applications include thermoelectric power generation, thermal management of power electronics and microelectronics, water purification, and heating, cooling and air-conditioning systems. However, flow boiling is significantly affected by five major forces such as surface tension, inertia, shear, vapor evaporation momentum, and gravitational force. The significant changes of channel sizes and working conditions (such as flow rate, heat load, and temperature) result in various contributions of these five forces and hence drastic changes of flow boiling patterns and performance. In addition, it is extremely challenging to conduct experiments of flow boiling in a wide range of channel sizes and working conditions due to the prohibitive costs and efforts. In this project, a package of ?Deep Models of Flow Boiling? will be developed to understand the effects of these major forces on flow boiling through the combined use of ground and microgravity experiments and the machine learning based techniques. The models are aimed to not only predicting flow boiling characteristics but also creating synthetic images of flow patterns. This project will pave the way for performing virtual flow boiling experiments under a wide range of working conditions. Furthermore, it would provide a powerful platform to study and design flow boiling-based water-energy systems in a significantly more comprehensive and economic way.<br/><br/>The challenging objective of developing the deep models of flow boiling will be achieved by three major research tasks. First, high-resolution experiments and dataset will be constructed. In order to assure accurate and more continuous inputs for machine learning, a complete and accurate data pool of flow boiling will be built through high-resolution experiments under a wide range of working conditions in terrestrial conditions on a test setup that is identical with the test section of the NASA Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE) on the International Space Station (ISS). Experimental data on the FBCE in ISS will be also collected to provide a quality dataset in microgravity.

It is well established that rainfall triggers mudflows on recently burned slopes. After wildfires, the surficial burned soil is water-repellent or hydrophobic, preventing rain infiltration and leading to sudden and rapid mudflows. Post-wildfire gravity-driven mudflows are unpredictable, occur suddenly, and travel rapidly downhill, turning into debris flows and mobilizing large and heavy boulders. In January 2018 in Montecito, California, an intense 15-minute burst turned into a devastating debris flow which caused 21 deaths, led to $421 million in damages, and closed key transit corridors. The experiments will examine how the attachment of hydrophobic soil particles to air bubbles leads to the formation of aggregates that may give rise to the unusual flow behaviors observed in mudflows. Particle-air-water mixtures form interesting structures (bubbles, pipes and clusters) whose shapes are primarily governed by a balance between gravity and the attractive forces between air bubbles and water-repellent particles. The experiments on the ISS and on Earth will use a model system consisting of sand particles that have been made hydrophobic through a chemical treatment, air and water. After mixing, the material will flow through a plexiglas channel, and particle motions and evolution of aggregates will be imaged and correlated with characteristics of the overall flow. By comparing experiments on the ISS with those on Earth, the role of gravity in aggregate formation and flow behavior will be understood. The results of this study will help understand how mudslides are affected by rainfall intensity and duration and could lead to better early-warning systems and risk evaluation. The research team will include students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and the project will support educational activities to high-school students in local communities.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to run experiments on Earth and in microgravity conditions to correlate mudflow composition with flow and transport characteristics on a micromechanical level. An understanding of the role of gravity on microstructural changes in flowing air-water-particle mixtures and, in particular, on the formation of particle-bubble agglomerates is crucial for predicting the rheological behavior of mudflows. Experiments will focus on how mudflow shear behavior depends on relative amounts of water, trapped air, and particles of various sizes. Experiments on Earth will identify how the mixture composition affect flow behavior and will delineate critical parameter ranges to be tested on board the ISS. Microgravity experiments will study the dynamics of hydrophobic particle attachment to air bubbles and the consequences of agglomeration on mixture flow and transport. Results will be used to derive governing equations that can describe the flow behavior of the mixtures, including effects of mixture rheology on the flow. Understanding the processes of mudslide initiation with respect to rainfall intensity and duration will lead to a more accurate predictive capability for the onset and development of mudslides that could mitigate catastrophic damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project accomplishes these goals with a combination of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations. The research team will use a model system consisting of a transparent tube lined with a clear gel to image the motion of the liquid and the deformation of the gel. Onboard the ISS, the liquid will spontaneously imbibe the gel-coated tube due to capillarity, while in Earth experiments, gravity will drive its motion in addition to capillary wicking. The team will then develop predictive models for the transport of liquid plugs in small and large ducts, accounting for both the local viscoelastic dissipation in the gel at the moving contact lines and the global viscous dissipation in the viscous fluid plug. This work will provide new insights into the delivery of drugs in the lungs to support improved treatment strategies; the results may also lead to engineering solutions for intermittent flows in pipes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, due to the dominant filmwise condensation mode, where vapors are condensed in the form of a film that covers the surface, in industry practice, condensation heat transfer rate is typically several folds lower than that of boiling or evaporation, leading to oversized- and overweighted-condensers. Highly efficient flow condensation is greatly desirable. Two-phase flow instabilities or oscillations in flow boiling and condensation can have detrimental effects on the system. Although extensive efforts have been taken to understand and manage the two-phase oscillation in flow boiling, only a few studies have been conducted in understanding two-phase condensing flow instabilities. This project would provide valuable knowledge and lead to novel control strategies in achieving the desirable flow pattern. If successful, this research project would improve not only the stability of condenser operations, but also the efficiency if two-phase oscillations can be properly utilized to enhance flow condensation. This project also offers a unique opportunity to promote interdisciplinary collaborations among thermal science, space technology, and machine learning. These types of collaborations would greatly benefit the communities of thermal science, machine learning, space industry, terrestrial water-energy industries, stakeholders, and science and technology education.<br/><br/>The research objectives are to understand transient behaviors of flow condensation and their impacts on flow condensation rate in both ground and microgravity environments. New knowledge obtained in this study would advance understandings of operation parameters that govern flow condensation oscillations. The research objectives can be realized in five tasks: (a) systematically characterizing transient behaviors of flow condensation, (b) understanding the dependence of different two-phase flow patterns on the vapor flow changing rate and/or cooling rate, (c) identifying the range of operation conditions that generate intensive two-phase oscillations; (d) characterizing the influence of oscillation modes on flow condensation rate with an emphasis on enhancing flow condensation; and (e) developing machine-learning-based models to accurately predict transient behaviors of flow condensation, flow condensation rate and pressure drop, which are more accessible than the traditional two-phase experiments to research communities, industries, students, and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During severe community-acquired pneumonia, Spn enters and causes long-lasting damage in vital organs such as the heart. Despite the use of antibiotics to treat the pneumonia, a large number of these patients are still at risk for heart disease. Current knowledge confirms that Spn can infect the heart and establish biofilms within the heart muscle, resulting in cell death and muscle dysfunction. However, there is still an incomplete understanding of critical factors that allow Spn to overcome treatment with antibiotics and cause damage in the heart. In this project, a Cardiac Tissue Chip (CTC) model will be used to study Spn infections. The space environment (which has been shown to worsen bacterial infections) will enable the researchers to clearly identify important factors that play a role in this process to identify new treatment options. This project will also provide multi-disciplinary training opportunities for 1 graduate student, 2 undergraduate students and 2 high school students. The undergraduate students will be recruited via UABs PARAdiGM program (Preparation for graduate and medical school), a summer program for undergraduates from disadvantaged and underrepresented minority backgrounds who are keen to explore the potential of a future career as a scientific investigator or medical professional. Research outcomes from this project will be incorporated into modules for two courses focused on stem cell bioengineering and heart failure.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to exploit unique phenomena associated with the space environment to create a model of Spn infection of cardiac tissue to gain an understanding of critical molecular signaling pathways associated with the onset and progression of Spn infections that lead to cardiac tissue dysfunction. In space, multiple factors affect normal tissue and cellular function, such as promoting cardiac tissue atrophy making it more susceptible to bacterial infection. There is also sufficient evidence to suggest that the space environment, particularly microgravity, greatly increases bacterial virulence and diminishes susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial treatments. This project will leverage the space environment to amplify the effects of Spn infection to more effectively identify molecular changes (gene expression, soluble factor production) involved in critical events that promote Spn cardiotoxicity. Elucidation of molecular mechanisms at play will enable identification of therapeutic targets for early intervention to prevent adverse cardiac events. Successful completion of this project will confirm that the tissue-level and organ-level changes engendered by the space environment accelerate and exacerbate bacterial infection and will yield valuable information regarding: (a) how Spn infection of cardiac tissue is different on earth and in space, (b) molecular mechanisms that promote enhanced virulence and biofilm formation, (c) factors that promote increased drug resistance in space, and (d) identification of potential therapeutic targets for early intervention to prevent adverse cardiac events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary results indicate that eddy current-induced forces and torques produced in the objects by the magnetic fields can be used to achieve this objective, paving way for an entirely new class of robotic manipulation opportunity. The knowledge gained in this research has the potential to contribute a solution to a major problem facing humanity: orbital space debris. Most space debris is made of aluminum: a conductive but non-magnetic material. There is a dire need for remediation strategies to remove debris already in orbit and to repair or remove human-made objects before they become new debris, to protect the fast-growing number of satellites that the world?s population has grown to rely on. This award will also support training and mentorship of graduate students, inclusion of undergraduate students in research, and outreach to K-12 students through university programs.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to test the conjecture that physical modeling and robot-learning techniques can be combined to improve manipulation of conductive non-magnetic objects for which a model exists, and enable manipulation of objects with no prior model, using multiple stationary electromagnetic rotating-dipole-field sources that partially surround the object. The investigation will explore the optimal manipulation of conductive objects for which a model of eddy current-induced force-torque already exists. It will also elucidate a generalized model for eddy current-induced force-torque on conductive spheres of varying size, wall thickness, and material to serve as a first-order approximation for other conductive object geometries. The scope also includes examination of cases where the system lacks a model of the target object and must acquire one online from sensor observations.

They offer valuable insight into combustion processes in practical combustion devices, such as engines. These flames were discovered in 2012 aboard the International Space Station (ISS), and since then this has been the only platform for observing them. To date all the ISS cool flames have involved liquid droplet fuels. This has limited the number of fuels to be observed and the ability to observe truly steady flames. For this project, experiments aboard the ISS will be performed using gaseous hydrocarbon fuels burning as nearly steady spherical flames. These flames will be supported by spherical porous burners. Their observation, with the most advanced combustion diagnostics available aboard the ISS, will allow the development of new chemical kinetics mechanisms and computational tools for combustion research. The improved understanding of cool diffusion flames gained by these experiments will lead to improved designs of practical combustion devices.<br/><br/>The discovery of cool diffusion flames has spawned a rapidly growing research field, but only a few measurements at limited conditions are available. Consequently, cool flame chemical kinetics mechanisms cannot be adequately tested or advanced, but such knowledge is needed to design cleaner and more efficient internal combustion engines. The objectives of this project are to observe diverse cool diffusion flames aboard the ISS, to simulate the tests with advanced computational models, and to advance chemical kinetics mechanisms that can accurately model these flames. The ISS is the only platform for observing spherical cool diffusion flames because they require about 20 s of microgravity to establish and even longer to reach steady state. The flames will be supported by a 6-mm spherical burner fed with propane, n-butane, or n-pentane. Normal and inverse flames will be considered, including a broad range of dilution conditions and pressures. The burners, gas delivery system, and diagnostics will be those used by the previous ISS flight experiments. The diagnostics will support color video, imaging of excited CH* and CH2O*, and measurements of gas temperatures, radiative emissions, optical emissions from H2O and OH, and ambient gas compositions. The research will be disseminated widely to the combustion research community and to industry. There will be outreach activities to attract secondary school students to engineering. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in cool flame kinetics mechanisms, which in turn should lead to cleaner, more efficient internal combustion engines."

Heat pipes use a fluid to transfer heat, but an essential feature of the device is that the fluid undergoes change of phase between liquid and vapor.  The detailed motion of the liquid and vapor, and the motion and dynamics of the interface between the two phases, can strongly affect the performance of heat pipes and similar systems.  Recent results suggest that the use of a fluid mixture, instead of a pure fluid, can help overcome limitations on performance and unanticipated failures of multiphase heat transfer systems.  This project will use the constrained vapor bubble system on board the International Space Station (ISS) to examine various interfacial phenomena for mixtures of organic fluids.  Parallel experiments conducted on Earth will help reveal the influence of gravity on interfacial dynamics and heat transfer performance characteristics.  Results from the project will provide information that practitioners can use to improve phase-change heat and mass transfer operations, which are becoming increasingly important in fields such as energy conversion, distillation, microelectronics cooling, coating processes, and space exploration.   The project will also provide opportunities for students to participate in research through Rensselaer's Undergraduate Research Program.<br/> <br/>This project will investigate interfacial phenomena and thermal-fluid performance for pentane/isohexane fluid mixtures in a wickless heat pipe.  Parallel experiments on Earth and on the ISS will address fundamental issues, including the effects of Marangoni forces on fluid motion and device performance.  Condensation and the presence of Leidenfrost droplets at the hot ends of the device are of particular interest.  The project will examine mixtures near 50:50 composition for which ground-based experiments have shown deviations from ideal mixture behavior.  These deviations will be magnified in microgravity and will alter interfacial characteristics and heat transfer performance of the wickless heat pipe.  The experiments will map the vapor-liquid interface using multi-wavelength interferometry.  This technique can isolate curvature gradients that drive fluid flow and can determine whether a phase change is occurring locally within the liquid menisci present throughout the device.  Particular focus will be given to regions near the heated end of the device where the competition between Marangoni and capillary forces can lead to a new limitation on performance and where disjoining pressure/intermolecular force effects appear to promote unexpected condensation.  The interface mapping will be combined with temperature profile measurements to understand, and ultimately predict, the thermal performance of these devices.  Using stopped motion and video applications of the interferometry technique, the stability of the liquid menisci and how stability depends upon heat input and liquid composition will be explored.  Thermal-fluid models will be developed to help explain the observations both at the meniscus and the device levels.  Results of the project will lead to the design of better thermal management devices that rely on phase change heat transfer and will help outline the limits of evaporation and condensation processes, the stability of liquid menisci, and the applicability of the ideal fluid mixture approximation, one of the cornerstones of phase equilibrium thermodynamics."

Astronomers are interested in them as they are objects representative of the primitive Solar System material that made the planets.  Some asteroids have been observed with telescopes to show dust-loss activity normally seen only with comets.  These are called ""active asteroids"", as they have orbits and surface characteristics of asteroids. This grant will study whether an asteroid spinning around its axis disrupts dust or particles on its surface, which are then shed off the surface of the asteroid in a landslide, creating the comet-like activity that is observed. If this process is happening, it is linked to the types of materials in the dust layer on the surface of the asteroid. The investigators will study how and why this is happening, using experiments and comparing the results with telescopic observations.  This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of the composition and structure of primitive materials used to create the early planets in our Solar System.  The lead investigator will recruit and guide undergraduate students for experiment design, manufacturing, operation, and data analysis in the Center for Microgravity Research laboratory, exposing them to hands-on space-related activities.<br/><br/>The active asteroids are classified as asteroids because their dynamical and spectral characteristics clearly tie them to asteroid taxonomy classes, yet they display activity in the form of particle loss at rates ranging from 10^-2 to 10^-4 kg/s. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that mass shedding on small asteroids can occur due to landslides, a process intimately linked to the material and mechanical properties of regolith (the asteroid's surface dust layer). The proposed work will investigate regolith structural failure from rotational disruption as a possible origin for the dust ejection activity observed on a number of these asteroids, for which other dust production mechanisms were ruled out.  The investigators combine laboratory experiments with regolith simulants, numerical simulations, and corroboration with ground-based telescopic observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attaining all three of these characteristics at the same time is possible in a substance called a dusty plasma, which is a mixture of highly charged micron-size solid particles immersed in a partially ionized gas consisting of electrons, ions, and neutral molecules.  In this project, large amplitude waves will be observed using video microscopy and manipulated using an experimental instrument on the International Space Station. An undergraduate student will carry out the analysis. The topic has an overlap with other fields of research including nonlinear dynamics as well as other plasma physics areas outside of dusty plasmas.<br/><br/>The data to be analyzed are mainly from the PK-4 instrument, which is a European-Russian apparatus now on the International Space Station. Data returned to Earth are distributed to scientists at other locations including The University of Iowa. A scientific video camera images a cross-section of a cloud of polymer microspheres, which are electrically charged due to their immersion in a weakly ionized plasma. This so-called dust cloud sustains waves such as dust acoustic wave and ionization striations; these waves grow naturally, by an instability, to attain nonlinear amplitudes. The use of data from PK-4 is valuable because under microgravitiy conditions, the dust cloud fills a three-dimensional volume of greater size than is possible in laboratory experiments on Earth. To support this effort the investigators will collaborate with theorists in describing the nonlinear motion.  This award to support an undergraduate student is made under a ""NASA/NSF Partnership on Science of Dusty Plasmas: Utilizing the PK-4 Facility on board the International Space Station"" and is complementary to a NASA award made under the joint program."
