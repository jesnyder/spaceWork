Understanding the effects of extreme environments such as space travel on human heart tissues is hampered
by the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models that can mimic clinical conditions from the patient’s own
cells. Patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes self-assembled into
multicellular, three-dimensional structures in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix offer an excellent
surrogate to recapitulate normal physiology and disease. In this UG3/UH3 proposal, we aim to generate an
ethnically diverse heart tissue array for drug screening in patient groups that manifest severe phenotype after
exposure to microgravity in space.",NCATS,10670018,9/6/2022 12:00:00 AM,PA-20-272,3UH3TR002588-04S1,3,UH3,TR,2588,4,S,"TAGLE, DANILO A",7/22/2022 12:00:00 AM,1/31/2023 12:00:00 AM, , ,2204699,"WU, JOSEPH C.","PRUITT, BETH L",18,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,9214214,HJD6G4D6TJY5,9214214,HJD6G4D6TJY5,US,37.426852,-122.17047,8046501,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,943052004,UNITED STATES,N,9/6/2022 12:00:00 AM,1/31/2023 12:00:00 AM,350,Non-SBIR/STTR,2022,196612, ,NCATS,175252,21360, ,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue engineered organs or functional tissue-like ensembles contribute significantly to our understanding of
cellular niches that allow cells to migrate, develop and mature in three dimensions (3-D). Conventional two-
dimensional (2-D) mammalian cell culture does not represent the physiological environments that form the
basis for normal cell function. A 3-D environment promotes isotropic cell-cell communications, provides
extracellular guidance from structural matrix scaffolding, and allows spatiotemporal remodelling. Our specific
interest is in investigating the effects of microgravity on heart function with the use of Engineered Heart
Tissues (EHTs). Since these tissue engineering platforms support multicellular architecture from a ‘bottom-
up’ approach, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of heart development from a primordial state.
Although animal models are used widely to investigate biological responses to therapeutics, inherent
differences between human and animal biology combined with the unlikelihood of animals developing a
human disease limit the ability to validate research findings. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)
have emerged as an indispensable tool to drive cells from an embryonic state to any somatic cell type. Our
laboratory’s focus and expertise in generating hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and modelling of
cardiomyopathies has yielded deeper insight into several rare and common causes of heart failure. To
maintain a tissue-specific microenvironment, dissociated cells must be cultured in a physiologically relevant
3-D extracellular matrix (ECM). In the first phase (UG3), we will generate hiPSC-CMs from healthy patients
belonging to diverse racial groups (Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans). The hiPSC-CMs will be
used to fabricate our well-characterized EHT platforms, to understand cellular mechanisms that affect cardiac
function both under microgravity and earth’s gravity. Alterations in cardiac function due to weakened heart
muscles in the samples exposed to microgravity will be matched with molecular and electrophysiological
disease patterns observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the second phase (UH3), the well-characterized
microgravity-induced disease phenotype will be translated on Heart Tissue Arrays (HTA) to screen for
potential drug candidates in a high-throughput manner. The proposed study will for the first time reveal key
functional and molecular differences that drive phenotypic changes in heart tissues on EHT assemblies under
influence of microgravity.",196612

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed project will provide important data regarding the role of microgravity on the structure and
physiological function of 3D human cardiac tissue. Knowledge gleaned from this study could be used to develop
technologies to better combat the negative effects caused by long-term exposure to microgravity. Furthermore,
our high-throughput microphysiological platform could eventually lead to a useful product to help screen new
potential therapies for their capacity to attenuate cardiomyopathies on Earth, as well as for the study of disease
progression in vitro.

PROJECT SUMMARY
Spaceflight has been shown to have a negative impact on the heart and the cardiovascular system. As we plan
for exploration class missions that will see humans spend longer periods of time in space, such as in a manned
missions to Mars, the potential impact of spaceflight on the heart and cardiovascular system will likely be
increased. Additionally, the effects of spaceflight on the human body appear to mimic an accelerated aging
process. Given that heart disease is the number one killer of all adults in the U.S., an understanding of the
cardiogenic effects of microgravity may have implications for helping to treat millions of heart disease patients
on Earth. Unfortunately, much is still unknown regarding the effect of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system
and the heart in particular. To address this issue, we will develop a high-throughput microphysiological model of
human cardiac muscle, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), in order to study the effects
of microgravity on cardiac tissue structure and physiological function. We will combine this cell source with a
cardiac-specific decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based electroconductive composite scaffold to
promote the maturation of cultured cells. The technologies developed during this study will facilitate the
generation of mature 3D engineered cardiac tissues that recapitulate the microarchitecture and function of
human myocardium. The data collected using this platform aboard the International Space Station (ISS) will
provide a better understanding of how prolonged microgravity affects the structure and function of the human
heart. During the UG3 phase of this proposal, we will assess differences in cardiac function and physiological
maturation between cells maintained in normal gravity and microgravity environments. Engineered heart tissues
(EHTs) made from hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes will be flown aboard the ISS for one month and be compared
to identical ground controls. Real-time assessment of EHT contractility will be achieved via a novel magnetic
coil-based motion sensor array, facilitating real-time and continuous assessment of function with minimal
demands from the flight crew. Progressing to the UH3 phase, we will focus on the assessment of novel
therapeutic strategies with which to attenuate microgravity-induced cardiomyopathy. We will assess both drug
compounds and mechanical stimulation interventions and analyze each in isolation and in concert for their ability
to improve cardiac function in space. The outcomes of this research could further improve our understanding of
the progression of chronic heart diseases on Earth, and help drive the development of new therapeutic strategies
for these debilitating conditions.

The increasing importance of technology in contemporary society necessitates a STEM literate population.
This represents a challenge for traditionally underrepresented populations (people of color, individuals with
disabilities, individuals in less affluent communities) impacting upward social mobility. Often, members of
these groups are doubly disadvantaged, as the few who become first generation college students often lack a
roadmap for success through family, near peers and potential mentors. Success for this population,
representing a highly motivated group, needs to be nurtured to embrace and advance STEM disciplines,
before they reach their college classrooms. This necessitates the education not only of students, but their
teachers, providing synergies in teaching and learning to empower students to avail of opportunities perceived
as being beyond their reach. We hypothesize that bridging this expanding gap requires an integrated program
bringing together academic, social and real-world professional experiences to establish a pipeline linking
success in middle/high school to success for first generation college students and beyond. Such a pipeline will
generate not only STEM-proficient citizens but also a cadre of near peers to motivate by example. With this
central premise we have formed the STEM Through Authentic Research and Training (START) Program tot
identify recruit and retaining traditionally underrepresented populations by providing year-round authentic
research opportunities and professional development for high school students (grades 9-12) and middle and
secondary STEM teachers (grades 5-12). START represents a partnership between the University of Kentucky
providing opportunities for STEM research, The Academies of Lexington, a partnership with the Fayette
County Public Schools- focused on changing the traditional didactic model for STEM instruction, the KY-WV
LSAMP program an NSF funded consortium led by UK including over 10 diverse academic institutions
supporting undergraduate research aimed at increasing the representation and overall success of traditionally
underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. START establishes a natural pipeline to the collegiate
level by virtue of the alliance with KY-WV LSAMP and its member institutions. Finally, we have recruited Space
Tango, a Lexington STEM start-up company which builds and integrates systems for scientific and biomedical
research under microgravity conditions on the international space station. As such, a spectrum of research
opportunities, from the molecular and microscopic level in participating UK STEM laboratories to the vastness
of space itself afforded by Space Tango provide an exciting palate of opportunities for traditionally
underrepresented students and the teachers responsible for their STEM education. We believe that the
integration of real world authentic research opportunities in the context of overall STEM education via a unique
partnership between academia, educational and commercial entities will motivate underrepresented student
populations to levels of achievement they often believe are beyond their horizons.",260155

 Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) in collaboration with New York University (NYU) School of Medicine
proposes to develop a novel ophthalmic imaging platform for characterizing retinal morphology and
monitoring ocular blood flow abnormalities. This platform will combine non-invasive measurements of
retina/choroid structure and ocular blood flow based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and wide-
field semi-quantitative global flow visualization using line-scanning Doppler flowmetry (LSDF). The
combination of these two imaging modalities within the same imaging platform enables comprehensive
assessment of blood flow in the retina and choroid. This novel imaging platform will enable imaging
studies in animals and human subjects with normal vision or with various retinal diseases. Prior PSI
experience in developing advanced ophthalmic imaging systems coupled with our collaborators' expertise
in Ophthalmology will be leveraged to ensure the successful outcome of this important R&D program.
 A feasibility study will be performed during the Phase I program by imaging normal and diseased rodent
models using a benchtop instrument. A clinical prototype instrument will be manufactured and tested
clinically in Phase II in the NYU population of patients to highlight hemodynamic retinal biomarkers. We
choose to focus on diseases that are the leading causes of blindness including, age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma to demonstrate the clinical utility of our novel
system. We will recruit healthy individuals to set a reference, and subjects with AMD, DR, and glaucoma at
a wide range of disease severity. In all of these conditions, the ability to record in vivo blood flow will
provide novel information that will open new diagnostic and treatment avenues.",482523

molecular mechanisms that transduce the osteoblast response to physical forces in the bone microenvironment
to maintain skeletal homeostasis are poorly understood. We discovered a novel mechanosensing complex in
osteoblasts created by an interaction between polycystins (PC1, Pkd1 and PC2, Pkd2) and TAZ (transcriptional
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif). The PC1/PC2/TAZ complex functions to sense and transduce mechanical
loading into anabolic bone responses. Loss of either Pkd1 or Taz in mice results in osteopenia characterized by
a reciprocal decrease in osteoblast-mediated bone formation and an increase in adipocytes in bone marrow.
Compound heterozygous mice lacking one copy of Pkd1 and TAZ exhibit additive decrements in bone mass,
impaired osteoblast-mediated bone formation and enhanced accumulation of bone marrow fat. The PC1 C-ter-
minal tail (PC1-CTT) binds to and facilitates TAZ nuclear translocation to co-activate Runx2-mediated osteoblas-
togenesis and co-repress PPAR-mediated adipogenesis in vitro. Computational approaches using structure-
based virtual screening discovered a novel agonist (mechanomimetic) that binds to the PC1:PC2 C-terminal tail
helix: helix interaction region and activates polycystins/TAZ signaling. These observations provide the scientific
premise for the hypothesis that skeletal responses to loading are transduced by a mechanosensing complex in
osteoblasts formed by interactions between PC1, PC2 and TAZ. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that Pkd1/TAZ have
interdependent functions in mature osteoblasts to regulate bone mass through the reciprocal stimulation of os-
teoblastogenesis and inhibition of adipogenesis. In this aim, we will examine the effects of TAZ to differentially
regulate osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo by creating mice with conditional knockout of
Taz in mature osteoblasts (TazOc-cko). We will further test for genetic interactions between Taz and Pkd1 by
creating compound Pkd1Oc-cko/Taz Oc-cko mice. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the Pkd1/TAZ complex mediates
the response of osteoblasts to mechanical loading in vivo and in vitro using single and compound Pkd1 and Taz
loss-of-function mouse models and osteoblast cultures. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that activation of the
PC1/PC2/TAZ with a novel “mechanomimetic” will increase bone mass by stimulating osteoblastogenesis and
inhibiting adipogenesis. Our impact will be to provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms medi-
ating the skeletal response to loading by validating the PC1/PC2/TAZ mechanosensing complex in osteoblasts.
In this new schema, PC1-CTT and TAZ form an integrative mechanosensing complex in cells within the osteo-
blast lineage to differentially regulate Runx2-dependent osteoblastogenesis and PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis
in response to physical cues in the bone microenvironment. The polycystins/TAZ complex is also a potential
therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis caused by skeletal unloading; and the newly discovered first-in-class
mechanomimetic provides a chemical probe to test if targeting polycystins/TAZ results in increased bone mass.",331056

Spaceflight has been shown to have negative impacts on the heart, with cardiac arrythmias observed in
astronauts and the risk of adverse cardiac events increasing significantly in astronauts who traveled beyond low
Earth orbit. Despite these observations, little is known about the underlying mechanistic reasons at the cell and
tissue level. To address this, we developed a high-throughput microphysiological engineered heart tissue (EHT)
model of human cardiac tissue, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to study the effects
of spaceflight on cardiac cell and tissue structure and function. These EHTs are generated with a biomimetic
extracellular matrix composition and stiffness with increased tissue conductivity, which improves overall tissue
unction and is more analogous to adult human myocardium than many previous models. During the first phase
of the parental grant, these EHTs were launched to the International Space Station (ISS), where contractile
forces were measured in real time using a magnet-based force sensor system. Following 28 days in microgravity,
tissue contractile function was impaired and mitochondrial dysfunction was observed. During the UH3 phase, a
random positioning machine is being used to simulate microgravity and to test attenuating strategies. In this
project, we will establish an in-house data management system to rigorously organize the datasets of the
parental grant. These datasets will encompass control tissue function of physiologically-relevant tissues in our
microphysiological system, tissues under real and simulated microgravity, and results of therapeutic screens on
tissue function. It will also include information on strategies to prevent drug absorption in the polymeric
components of our system. Once organized, the data will be compatible with, and deposited into, the
Microphysiology Systems Database (MPS-Db), where it will be publicly available. Our data will expedite the
development of technologies to combat the adverse cardiovascular effects caused by long-term exposure to
microgravity. Additionally, the effects of spaceflight on the human body appear to mimic an accelerated aging
process, including cardiac deterioration, in the general human population. We expect our data will also facilitate
the development of technologies and therapies to attenuate cardiomyopathies on Earth.",80419

Many space-related physiological changes resemble those observed during aging, including defects in bone
healing, loss of cardiovascular and neurological capacity, and altered immune function. We hypothesize that
microgravity-related aging of the immune system is associated with an increase of terminally differentiated
CD8+ effector memory T (TEMRA) cells which impair stem-cell based tissue regenerative health. This project
proposal aims to investigate the relationship between an individual’s immune aging and healing outcomes, and
to investigate the biology of aging from two directions—not only during its development in microgravity
conditions but also during recovery.",NCATS,10414831,9/2/2021 12:00:00 AM,PA-20-272,3UH3TR002192-04S1,3,UH3,TR,2192,4,S,"TAGLE, DANILO A",6/15/2017 12:00:00 AM,6/30/2022 12:00:00 AM, , ,9465499,"SCHREPFER, SONJA ","DEUSE, TOBIAS ",12,SURGERY,94878337,KMH5K9V7S518,94878337,KMH5K9V7S518,US,37.767442,-122.413937,577508,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",SAN FRANCISCO,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,941432510,UNITED STATES,N,9/2/2021 12:00:00 AM,6/30/2022 12:00:00 AM,350,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,260009, ,NCATS,160996,99013, ,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is associated with dysregulation of the immune response, which is also termed “immunosenescence.”
Each part of the immune system is influenced to some extent by the aging process. However, adaptive immunity
seems more extensively affected, and it is especially the T cells that are altered. In fact, the number and
proportion of late-differentiated T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, is higher in the elderly than in the young and
their accumulation may contribute to the enhanced systemic pro-inflammatory milieu commonly seen in elderly
individuals. Interestingly, the proportion of CD8+ effector memory RA (TEMRA) cells increases significantly with
age, which is not seen for CD4+ cells. We do not know exactly what causes these observed changes, but an
understanding of the possible causes is now beginning to emerge. Spaceflight causes a suite of negative health
effects that may be comparable to immunosenescence, which seems to be a key regulator of the regenerative
capacity of tissue- and organ-specific stem cells. Organ-specific stem and progenitor cells may allow the design
of strategies for organ regeneration. The overarching objective of this proposal is to gain a better understanding
of the influence of immunosenescence on the regenerative capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Specifically,
studies examining the effects of bone healing (by mesenchymal stromal cells) and vascular regeneration (by
endothelial progenitor cells) are planned using tissue mimics on chip to represent “semi-3D” architectures.
Ultimately, we will use microgravity as an aging model, and we will translate those findings to improve human
health on Earth by using tissue chips on the ISS for up to a month. Notably, the proposed studies investigate
post-flight recovery of tissue chips using histological analysis combined with functional and genomic analysis. In
collaboration with Space Technology and Advanced Research Systems, Inc. - STaARS, well-versed in
maintenance of cell culture experiments in spaceflight, we are establishing an in vitro tissue-on-chip platform
that mimics human physiology to study the effect of immunosenescence on tissue-specific stem cells. This
system will be designed for use in the UH3 phase in the extreme environment of space. In the UG3 phase, we
will examine the effect of simulated microgravity and normal (1xg) conditions on in vitro cultures of CD8+ T cells
and on their co-culture with stem cells (UG3 Aim 1). In UG3 Aim 2 we will investigate the effect of microgravity
at the International Space Station – National Lab (ISS-NL) on in vitro co-cultures of CD8+ T cells and stem cells.
In the UH3 phase, we will determine the effect of microgravity on immunosenescence (differentiation of CD8+ T
cells into TEMRA cells) and tissue-specific stem cells in space as model for aging using microarrays (UH3 Aim 1).
Finally, in UH3 Aim 2, we will investigate post-flight recovery of tissue chips (from Aim 1, UH3 phase) using
functional analysis of stem cells. This proposal will contribute materially to our understanding of the impact of an
aged immune system on tissue healing and regeneration.",260009

Understanding the effects of extreme environments such as space travel on human heart tissues is hampered
by the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models that can mimic clinical conditions from the patient’s own
cells. Patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes self-assembled into
multicellular, three-dimensional structures in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix offer an excellent
surrogate to recapitulate normal physiology and disease. In this UG3/UH3 proposal, we aim to generate an
ethnically diverse heart tissue array for drug screening in patient groups that manifest severe phenotype after
exposure to microgravity in space.",NCATS,10239266,8/16/2021 12:00:00 AM,RFA-TR-18-001,5UH3TR002588-04,5,UH3,TR,2588,4, ,"TAGLE, DANILO A",9/18/2018 12:00:00 AM,1/31/2023 12:00:00 AM,ZTR1-DPI-7(01), ,2204699,"WU, JOSEPH C.","PRUITT, BETH L",18,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,9214214,HJD6G4D6TJY5,9214214,HJD6G4D6TJY5,US,37.426852,-122.17047,8046501,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,STANFORD,CA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,943052004,UNITED STATES,N,8/1/2021 12:00:00 AM,1/31/2023 12:00:00 AM,350,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,714532, ,NCATS,868242,299530, ,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue engineered organs or functional tissue-like ensembles contribute significantly to our understanding of
cellular niches that allow cells to migrate, develop and mature in three dimensions (3-D). Conventional two-
dimensional (2-D) mammalian cell culture does not represent the physiological environments that form the basis
for normal cell function. A 3-D environment promotes isotropic cell-cell communications, provides extracellular
guidance from structural matrix scaffolding, and allows spatiotemporal remodelling. Our specific interest is in
investigating the effects of microgravity on heart function with the use of Engineered Heart Tissues (EHTs). Since
these tissue engineering platforms support multicellular architecture from a ‘bottom-up’ approach, it is critical to
understand the mechanisms of heart development from a primordial state. Although animal models are used
widely to investigate biological responses to therapeutics, inherent differences between human and animal
biology combined with the unlikelihood of animals developing a human disease limit the ability to validate
research findings. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have emerged as an indispensable tool to
drive cells from an embryonic state to any somatic cell type. Our laboratory’s focus and expertise in generating
hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and modelling of cardiomyopathies has yielded deeper insight into
several rare and common causes of heart failure. To maintain a tissue-specific microenvironment, dissociated
cells must be cultured in a physiologically relevant 3-D extracellular matrix (ECM). In the first phase (UG3), we
will generate hiPSC-CMs from healthy patients belonging to diverse racial groups (Caucasians, Hispanics, and
African Americans). The hiPSC-CMs will be used to fabricate our well-characterized EHT platforms, to
understand cellular mechanisms that affect cardiac function both under microgravity and earth’s gravity.
Alterations in cardiac function due to weakened heart muscles in the samples exposed to microgravity will be
matched with molecular and electrophysiological disease patterns observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the
second phase (UH3), the well-characterized microgravity-induced disease phenotype will be translated on Heart
Tissue Arrays (HTA) to screen for potential drug candidates in a high-throughput manner. The proposed study
will for the first time reveal key functional and molecular differences that drive phenotypic changes in heart tissues
on EHT assemblies under influence of microgravity.",714532

The increasing importance of technology in contemporary society necessitates a STEM literate population.
This represents a challenge for traditionally underrepresented populations (people of color, individuals with
disabilities, individuals in less affluent communities) impacting upward social mobility. Often, members of
these groups are doubly disadvantaged, as the few who become first generation college students often lack a
roadmap for success through family, near peers and potential mentors. Success for this population,
representing a highly motivated group, needs to be nurtured to embrace and advance STEM disciplines,
before they reach their college classrooms. This necessitates the education not only of students, but their
teachers, providing synergies in teaching and learning to empower students to avail of opportunities perceived
as being beyond their reach. We hypothesize that bridging this expanding gap requires an integrated program
bringing together academic, social and real-world professional experiences to establish a pipeline linking
success in middle/high school to success for first generation college students and beyond. Such a pipeline will
generate not only STEM-proficient citizens but also a cadre of near peers to motivate by example. With this
central premise we have formed the STEM Through Authentic Research and Training (START) Program tot
identify recruit and retaining traditionally underrepresented populations by providing year-round authentic
research opportunities and professional development for high school students (grades 9-12) and middle and
secondary STEM teachers (grades 5-12). START represents a partnership between the University of Kentucky
providing opportunities for STEM research, The Academies of Lexington, a partnership with the Fayette
County Public Schools- focused on changing the traditional didactic model for STEM instruction, the KY-WV
LSAMP program an NSF funded consortium led by UK including over 10 diverse academic institutions
supporting undergraduate research aimed at increasing the representation and overall success of traditionally
underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. START establishes a natural pipeline to the collegiate
level by virtue of the alliance with KY-WV LSAMP and its member institutions. Finally, we have recruited Space
Tango, a Lexington STEM start-up company which builds and integrates systems for scientific and biomedical
research under microgravity conditions on the international space station. As such, a spectrum of research
opportunities, from the molecular and microscopic level in participating UK STEM laboratories to the vastness
of space itself afforded by Space Tango provide an exciting palate of opportunities for traditionally
underrepresented students and the teachers responsible for their STEM education. We believe that the
integration of real world authentic research opportunities in the context of overall STEM education via a unique
partnership between academia, educational and commercial entities will motivate underrepresented student
populations to levels of achievement they often believe are beyond their horizons.",263579

The development of low bone mass caused by aging, disuse due to paralysis, or extended space flights impacts
many individuals of all ages. Current therapeutics aim to slow the loss of bone mass, but none currently target the
lack of mechanical loading that leads to declining bone mass in these situations. We have recently described a
novel pathway in vitro in which NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2) produces reactive oxygen species following the
onset of fluid shear stress that, in turn, activates transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels to allow
for calcium influx. This ultimately results in calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) activation and
sclerostin degradation, lifting the inhibition on osteoblasts to allow for bone formation. Though the mechano-
transduction cascade controlling sclerostin abundance has been described in in vitro osteocytes, the fidelity and
impact of this signaling pathway's impact on sclerostin regulation and bone mass has not been examined in vivo.
This proposal will examine how the loss of NOX2, a necessary early step in the mechano-transduction cascade,
affects bone quality, both in unstimulated and mechanically-stimulated conditions, in an in vivo animal model.
Supported by in vitro and in vivo preliminary data, we hypothesize that the mechano-transduction pathway
controlling sclerostin in vitro is conserved in vivo and that disrupting NOX2-dependent ROS production will
affect basal bone properties and impair bone acquisition in response to mechanical load. We will address this
hypothesis in one aim with three independent experiments: (1) Examine how NOX2 deletion in osteocytes
impacts basal bone properties and mechano-responsiveness in vivo. Given the in vitro nature of our prior work on
this pathway, the contribution of this mechano-transduction pathway to in vivo bone mechano-responsiveness
remained unresolved. To extend these in vitro findings, this proposal will use in vitro and in vivo models,
specifically a conditional deletion model, to address several knowledge gaps, including the cell autonomous role
of NOX2 in osteocytes and the contribution of NOX2-mediated ROS to skeletal physiology and function. This
proposal will validate novel therapeutic targets, such as ROS production, which can be exploited to mimic load
in populations where traditional mechanical load is not possible.",34236

studies in animals and human subjects with normal vision or with various retinal diseases. Prior PSI
experience in developing advanced ophthalmic imaging systems coupled with our collaborators' expertise
in Ophthalmology will be leveraged to ensure the successful outcome of this important R&D program.
 A feasibility study will be performed during the Phase I program by imaging normal and diseased rodent
models using a benchtop instrument. A clinical prototype instrument will be manufactured and tested
clinically in Phase II in the NYU population of patients to highlight hemodynamic retinal biomarkers. We
choose to focus on diseases that are the leading causes of blindness including, age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma to demonstrate the clinical utility of our novel
system. We will recruit healthy individuals to set a reference, and subjects with AMD, DR, and glaucoma at
a wide range of disease severity. In all of these conditions, the ability to record in vivo blood flow will
provide novel information that will open new diagnostic and treatment avenues.",678314

The
molecular mechanisms that transduce the osteoblast response to physical forces in the bone microenvironment
to maintain skeletal homeostasis are poorly understood. We discovered a novel mechanosensing complex in
osteoblasts created by an interaction between polycystins (PC1, Pkd1 and PC2, Pkd2) and TAZ (transcriptional
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif). The PC1/PC2/TAZ complex functions to sense and transduce mechanical
loading into anabolic bone responses. Loss of either Pkd1 or Taz in mice results in osteopenia characterized by
a reciprocal decrease in osteoblast-mediated bone formation and an increase in adipocytes in bone marrow.
Compound heterozygous mice lacking one copy of Pkd1 and TAZ exhibit additive decrements in bone mass,
impaired osteoblast-mediated bone formation and enhanced accumulation of bone marrow fat. The PC1 C-ter-
minal tail (PC1-CTT) binds to and facilitates TAZ nuclear translocation to co-activate Runx2-mediated osteoblas-
togenesis and co-repress PPAR-mediated adipogenesis in vitro. Computational approaches using structure-
based virtual screening discovered a novel agonist (mechanomimetic) that binds to the PC1:PC2 C-terminal tail
helix: helix interaction region and activates polycystins/TAZ signaling. These observations provide the scientific
premise for the hypothesis that skeletal responses to loading are transduced by a mechanosensing complex in
osteoblasts formed by interactions between PC1, PC2 and TAZ. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that Pkd1/TAZ have
interdependent functions in mature osteoblasts to regulate bone mass through the reciprocal stimulation of os-
teoblastogenesis and inhibition of adipogenesis. In this aim, we will examine the effects of TAZ to differentially
regulate osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo by creating mice with conditional knockout of
Taz in mature osteoblasts (TazOc-cko). We will further test for genetic interactions between Taz and Pkd1 by
creating compound Pkd1Oc-cko/Taz Oc-cko mice. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the Pkd1/TAZ complex mediates
the response of osteoblasts to mechanical loading in vivo and in vitro using single and compound Pkd1 and Taz
loss-of-function mouse models and osteoblast cultures. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that activation of the
PC1/PC2/TAZ with a novel “mechanomimetic” will increase bone mass by stimulating osteoblastogenesis and
inhibiting adipogenesis. Our impact will be to provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms medi-
ating the skeletal response to loading by validating the PC1/PC2/TAZ mechanosensing complex in osteoblasts.
In this new schema, PC1-CTT and TAZ form an integrative mechanosensing complex in cells within the osteo-
blast lineage to differentially regulate Runx2-dependent osteoblastogenesis and PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis
in response to physical cues in the bone microenvironment. The polycystins/TAZ complex is also a potential
therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis caused by skeletal unloading; and the newly discovered first-in-class
mechanomimetic provides a chemical probe to test if targeting polycystins/TAZ results in increased bone mass.",324368

 Auscultation is a non-invasive, powerful and low-cost technique for detection and monitoring of respiratory
diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia and asthma, which are among leading
causes of disability and death globally. In this project, we will optimize the acoustic coupling of a wearable low-
profile accelerometer contact microphone to achieve a high-precision and low-profile wideband auscultation
microdevice, which can continuously and simultaneously record adventitious sounds from respiratory system as
well as heart sounds, respiratory rate and body motion to facilitate early detection and long-term monitoring. We
will optimize the device prototype and assess the feasibility of this device for detection of asthma in a clinical
setting and compare the results with medical-grade electronic stethoscopes output and with expert physician
diagnosis to validate the future use of this device in a broad range of healthcare settings.",NIBIB,10261583,9/2/2021 12:00:00 AM,PA-19-052,5R03EB029099-02,5,R03,EB,29099,2, ,"LASH, TIFFANI BAILEY",9/15/2020 12:00:00 AM,6/30/2023 12:00:00 AM,Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section[ISD], ,9836975,"AYAZI, FARROKH ",Not Applicable,5,ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES),97394084,EMW9FC8J3HN4,97394084,EMW9FC8J3HN4,US,33.781897,-84.404009,676603,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,ATLANTA,GA,BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA,303320415,UNITED STATES,N,7/1/2021 12:00:00 AM,6/30/2023 12:00:00 AM,286,Non-SBIR/STTR,2021,75502, ,NIBIB,62499,13003, ,"Summary: Respiratory diseases (RDs) are the fifth cause of death in the US and impose over $150B on
healthcare cost. RDs like asthma are incurable and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. As most
dangerous RDs are progressive and manageable with preventive treatment, early detection is crucial to prevent
exacerbation. Current diagnosis relies on costly and time-consuming clinical visits, discouraging preventative
screening without severe symptoms especially for low/middle-income population at higher RD risks due to more
exposure to tobacco and work-related particulates. Diagnosis of RDs like asthma also relies on detection of
intermittent abnormal respiratory sounds, which can benefit from prolonged recordings outside the clinic setting.
In this project, a low-cost, low-profile, easy-to-use and effective device will be developed to detect adventitial
asthma respiratory sounds, facilitating access to screening and continuous treatment monitoring in RD patients.
 Auscultation is a powerful, non-invasive and well-established method to evaluate health of cardiopulmonary
system through sounds of lung and heart. Stethoscopes have been used by physicians for over two centuries in
clinics, but they are unsuitable for continuous cardiopulmonary activities monitoring due to large form-factor and
dependence on listening skills and experience, prohibiting critical applications like ambulatory monitoring and
early detection of RDs in small children. A need exists for a low-profile, miniaturized, high-precision diagnostic
device that is more accessible and can accurately detect and quantify respiratory abnormalities over prolonged
measurements without relying on the skills and experience of a physician to interpret the sounds. To that end,
the electronic interface and acoustic coupling of a MEMS-based accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) onto
skin will be optimized to record respiratory sounds with high fidelity, and compared against clinical diagnosis.
 Breakthrough, hermetically-sealed, high-precision ACMs with unidirectional vibration sensitivity will be used
to overcome limits of standard stethoscopes that are bulky, susceptible to airborne and rubbing noise, and hard
to use. Besides lung and heart sounds, the ACM simultaneously acquires respiratory rate, heart rate and physical
activities of the users. Data will be analyzed using simple algorithms like time-frequency analysis and continuous
wavelet transformation to provide reliable information for diagnosis of asthma by detecting signature sounds like
wheezing in a wide frequency range of 100Hz-5kHz. Diagnosis accuracy and comprehensiveness are expected
to be improved by the ACM-enabled prolonged recording, capability of correlating respiratory sounds with heart
sounds and body motions, and detection of higher frequency signals. Interface between ACM and skin will be
optimized to increase acoustic coupling over a wide frequency range for wideband adventitious sounds. Low-
profile wearable ACMs will be used in a clinical setting to detect adventitial respiratory sounds indicative of
asthma and compared with medical-grade digital stethoscopes and clinician judgment. Potentials of the ACM for
detecting information for other RDs like COPD and pneumonia will also be assessed for future developments.",75502
